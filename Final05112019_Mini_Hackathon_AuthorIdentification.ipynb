              "'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE WHALE GOT HIS THROAT\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the sea, once upon a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a Whale, and\\r\\nhe ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish, and the crab and the\\r\\ndab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the\\r\\nmackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All\\r\\nthe fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till\\r\\nat last there was only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a\\r\\nsmall ‘Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale’s right ear,\\r\\nso as to be out of harm’s way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and\\r\\nsaid, ‘I’m hungry.’ And the small ‘Stute Fish said in a small ‘stute\\r\\nvoice, ‘Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Whale. ‘What is it like?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nice,’ said the small ‘Stute Fish. ‘Nice but nubbly.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then fetch me some,’ said the Whale, and he made the sea froth up with\\r\\nhis tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘One at a time is enough,’ said the ‘Stute Fish. ‘If you swim to\\r\\nlatitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you will\\r\\nfind, sitting _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, with nothing on\\r\\nbut a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must _not_\\r\\nforget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a jack-knife, one\\r\\nship-wrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell you, is a man of\\r\\ninfinite-resource-and-sagacity.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty\\r\\nWest, as fast as he could swim, and _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the\\r\\nsea, _with_ nothing to wear except a pair of blue canvas breeches, a\\r\\npair of suspenders (you must particularly remember the suspenders, Best\\r\\nBeloved), _and_ a jack-knife, he found one single, solitary shipwrecked\\r\\nMariner, trailing his toes in the water. (He had his mummy’s leave to\\r\\npaddle, or else he would never have done it, because he was a man of\\r\\ninfinite-resource-and-sagacity.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it nearly\\r\\ntouched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked Mariner, and the\\r\\nraft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas breeches, and the suspenders\\r\\n(which you _must_ not forget), _and_ the jack-knife--He swallowed them\\r\\nall down into his warm, dark, inside cup-boards, and then he smacked his\\r\\nlips--so, and turned round three times on his tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of\\r\\ninfinite-resource-and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the Whale’s\\r\\nwarm, dark, inside cup-boards, he stumped and he jumped and he thumped\\r\\nand he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he\\r\\nclanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and he\\r\\nprowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he cried and he\\r\\nsighed, and he crawled and he bawled, and he stepped and he lepped, and\\r\\nhe danced hornpipes where he shouldn’t, and the Whale felt most unhappy\\r\\nindeed. (_Have_ you forgotten the suspenders?)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he said to the ‘Stute Fish, ‘This man is very nubbly, and besides he\\r\\nis making me hiccough. What shall I do?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Tell him to come out,’ said the ‘Stute Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked Mariner,\\r\\n‘Come out and behave yourself. I’ve got the hiccoughs.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nay, nay!’ said the Mariner. ‘Not so, but far otherwise. Take me to my\\r\\nnatal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I’ll think about it.’\\r\\nAnd he began to dance more than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘You had better take him home,’ said the ‘Stute Fish to the Whale.\\r\\n ‘I ought to have warned you that he is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his tail,\\r\\nas hard as he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw the Mariner’s\\r\\nnatal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way\\r\\nup the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said,\\r\\n‘Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on\\r\\nthe _Fitch_burg Road;’ and just as he said ‘Fitch’ the Mariner walked\\r\\nout of his mouth. But while the Whale had been swimming, the Mariner,\\r\\nwho was indeed a person of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his\\r\\njack-knife and cut up the raft into a little square grating all running\\r\\ncriss-cross, and he had tied it firm with his suspenders (_now_, you\\r\\nknow why you were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged that\\r\\ngrating good and tight into the Whale’s throat, and there it stuck! Then\\r\\nhe recited the following _Sloka_, which, as you have not heard it, I\\r\\nwill now proceed to relate--\\r\\n\\r\\n  By means of a grating\\r\\n  I have stopped your ating.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Mariner he was also an Hi-ber-ni-an. And he stepped out on the\\r\\nshingle, and went home to his mother, who had given him leave to trail\\r\\nhis toes in the water; and he married and lived happily ever afterward.\\r\\nSo did the Whale. But from that day on, the grating in his throat,\\r\\nwhich he could neither cough up nor swallow down, prevented him eating\\r\\nanything except very, very small fish; and that is the reason why whales\\r\\nnowadays never eat men or boys or little girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small ‘Stute Fish went and hid himself in the mud under the\\r\\nDoor-sills of the Equator. He was afraid that the Whale might be angry\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sailor took the jack-knife home. He was wearing the blue canvas\\r\\nbreeches when he walked out on the shingle. The suspenders were left\\r\\nbehind, you see, to tie the grating with; and that is the end of _that_\\r\\ntale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     WHEN the cabin port-holes are dark and green\\r\\n       Because of the seas outside;\\r\\n     When the ship goes _wop_ (with a wiggle between)\\r\\n     And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,\\r\\n       And the trunks begin to slide;\\r\\n     When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,\\r\\n     And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,\\r\\n     And you aren’t waked or washed or dressed,\\r\\n     Why, then you will know (if you haven’t guessed)\\r\\n     You’re ‘Fifty North and Forty West!’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE CAMEL GOT HIS HUMP\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big hump.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the\\r\\nAnimals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he\\r\\nlived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work;\\r\\nand besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and\\r\\ntamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most ‘scruciating idle; and when\\r\\nanybody spoke to him he said ‘Humph!’ Just ‘Humph!’ and no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his\\r\\nback and a bit in his mouth, and said, ‘Camel, O Camel, come out and\\r\\ntrot like the rest of us.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Humph!’ said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said,\\r\\n‘Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Humph!’ said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said,\\r\\n‘Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Humph!’ said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox\\r\\ntogether, and said, ‘Three, O Three, I’m very sorry for you (with the\\r\\nworld so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can’t work,\\r\\nor he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and\\r\\nyou must work double-time to make up for it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they\\r\\nheld a palaver, and an _indaba_, and a _punchayet_, and a pow-wow on\\r\\nthe edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed _most_\\r\\n‘scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said ‘Humph!’ and went\\r\\naway again.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling\\r\\nin a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic),\\r\\nand he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Djinn of All Deserts,’ said the Horse, ‘is it right for any one to be\\r\\nidle, with the world so new-and-all?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly not,’ said the Djinn.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said the Horse, ‘there’s a thing in the middle of your Howling\\r\\nDesert (and he’s a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and\\r\\nhe hasn’t done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won’t trot.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whew!’ said the Djinn, whistling, ‘that’s my Camel, for all the gold in\\r\\nArabia! What does he say about it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He says “Humph!”’ said the Dog; ‘and he won’t fetch and carry.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Does he say anything else?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Only “Humph!”; and he won’t plough,’ said the Ox.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very good,’ said the Djinn. ‘I’ll humph him if you will kindly wait a\\r\\nminute.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across\\r\\nthe desert, and found the Camel most ‘scruciatingly idle, looking at his\\r\\nown reflection in a pool of water.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My long and bubbling friend,’ said the Djinn, ‘what’s this I hear of\\r\\nyour doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Humph!’ said the Camel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a\\r\\nGreat Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of\\r\\nwater.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You’ve given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on\\r\\naccount of your ‘scruciating idleness,’ said the Djinn; and he went on\\r\\nthinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Humph!’ said the Camel.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I shouldn’t say that again if I were you,’ said the Djinn; you might\\r\\nsay it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Camel said ‘Humph!’ again; but no sooner had he said it than he\\r\\nsaw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a\\r\\ngreat big lolloping humph.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Do you see that?’ said the Djinn. ‘That’s your very own humph that\\r\\nyou’ve brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is\\r\\nThursday, and you’ve done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now\\r\\nyou are going to work.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How can I,’ said the Camel, ‘with this humph on my back?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s made a-purpose,’ said the Djinn, ‘all because you missed those\\r\\nthree days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating,\\r\\nbecause you can live on your humph; and don’t you ever say I never\\r\\ndid anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and\\r\\nbehave. Humph yourself!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the\\r\\nThree. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call\\r\\nit ‘hump’ now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up\\r\\nwith the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he\\r\\nhas never yet learned how to behave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     THE Camel’s hump is an ugly lump\\r\\n       Which well you may see at the Zoo;\\r\\n     But uglier yet is the hump we get\\r\\n       From having too little to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,\\r\\n     If we haven’t enough to do-oo-oo,\\r\\n         We get the hump--\\r\\n         Cameelious hump--\\r\\n     The hump that is black and blue!\\r\\n\\r\\n     We climb out of bed with a frouzly head\\r\\n       And a snarly-yarly voice.\\r\\n     We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl\\r\\n       At our bath and our boots and our toys;\\r\\n\\r\\n     And there ought to be a corner for me\\r\\n     (And I know there is one for you)\\r\\n         When we get the hump--\\r\\n         Cameelious hump--\\r\\n     The hump that is black and blue!\\r\\n\\r\\n     The cure for this ill is not to sit still,\\r\\n       Or frowst with a book by the fire;\\r\\n     But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,\\r\\n       And dig till you gently perspire;\\r\\n\\r\\n     And then you will find that the sun and the wind.\\r\\n     And the Djinn of the Garden too,\\r\\n         Have lifted the hump--\\r\\n         The horrible hump--\\r\\n     The hump that is black and blue!\\r\\n\\r\\n     I get it as well as you-oo-oo--\\r\\n     If I haven’t enough to do-oo-oo--\\r\\n         We all get hump--\\r\\n         Cameelious hump--\\r\\n     Kiddies and grown-ups too!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE RHINOCEROS GOT HIS SKIN\\r\\n\\r\\nONCE upon a time, on an uninhabited island on the shores of the Red Sea,\\r\\nthere lived a Parsee from whose hat the rays of the sun were reflected\\r\\nin more-than-oriental splendour. And the Parsee lived by the Red Sea\\r\\nwith nothing but his hat and his knife and a cooking-stove of the kind\\r\\nthat you must particularly never touch. And one day he took flour and\\r\\nwater and currants and plums and sugar and things, and made himself one\\r\\ncake which was two feet across and three feet thick. It was indeed a\\r\\nSuperior Comestible (that’s magic), and he put it on stove because he\\r\\nwas allowed to cook on the stove, and he baked it and he baked it till\\r\\nit was all done brown and smelt most sentimental. But just as he\\r\\nwas going to eat it there came down to the beach from the Altogether\\r\\nUninhabited Interior one Rhinoceros with a horn on his nose, two piggy\\r\\neyes, and few manners. In those days the Rhinoceros’s skin fitted him\\r\\nquite tight. There were no wrinkles in it anywhere. He looked exactly\\r\\nlike a Noah’s Ark Rhinoceros, but of course much bigger. All the same,\\r\\nhe had no manners then, and he has no manners now, and he never will\\r\\nhave any manners. He said, ‘How!’ and the Parsee left that cake and\\r\\nclimbed to the top of a palm tree with nothing on but his hat, from\\r\\nwhich the rays of the sun were always reflected in more-than-oriental\\r\\nsplendour. And the Rhinoceros upset the oil-stove with his nose, and\\r\\nthe cake rolled on the sand, and he spiked that cake on the horn of his\\r\\nnose, and he ate it, and he went away, waving his tail, to the desolate\\r\\nand Exclusively Uninhabited Interior which abuts on the islands of\\r\\nMazanderan, Socotra, and Promontories of the Larger Equinox. Then the\\r\\nParsee came down from his palm-tree and put the stove on its legs and\\r\\nrecited the following Sloka, which, as you have not heard, I will now\\r\\nproceed to relate:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  Them that takes cakes\\r\\n  Which the Parsee-man bakes\\r\\n  Makes dreadful mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there was a great deal more in that than you would think.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, five weeks later, there was a heat wave in the Red Sea, and\\r\\neverybody took off all the clothes they had. The Parsee took off his\\r\\nhat; but the Rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it over his\\r\\nshoulder as he came down to the beach to bathe. In those days it\\r\\nbuttoned underneath with three buttons and looked like a waterproof. He\\r\\nsaid nothing whatever about the Parsee’s cake, because he had eaten\\r\\nit all; and he never had any manners, then, since, or henceforward.\\r\\nHe waddled straight into the water and blew bubbles through his nose,\\r\\nleaving his skin on the beach.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Parsee came by and found the skin, and he smiled one smile\\r\\nthat ran all round his face two times. Then he danced three times round\\r\\nthe skin and rubbed his hands. Then he went to his camp and filled his\\r\\nhat with cake-crumbs, for the Parsee never ate anything but cake, and\\r\\nnever swept out his camp. He took that skin, and he shook that skin, and\\r\\nhe scrubbed that skin, and he rubbed that skin just as full of old,\\r\\ndry, stale, tickly cake-crumbs and some burned currants as ever it could\\r\\npossibly hold. Then he climbed to the top of his palm-tree and waited\\r\\nfor the Rhinoceros to come out of the water and put it on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up with the three buttons, and\\r\\nit tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that\\r\\nmade it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled\\r\\nand rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse\\r\\nand worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed\\r\\nand rubbed himself against it. He rubbed so much and so hard that he\\r\\nrubbed his skin into a great fold over his shoulders, and another fold\\r\\nunderneath, where the buttons used to be (but he rubbed the buttons\\r\\noff), and he rubbed some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his\\r\\ntemper, but it didn’t make the least difference to the cake-crumbs.\\r\\nThey were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry\\r\\nindeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros\\r\\nhas great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the\\r\\ncake-crumbs inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Parsee came down from his palm-tree, wearing his hat, from which\\r\\nthe rays of the sun were reflected in more-than-oriental splendour,\\r\\npacked up his cooking-stove, and went away in the direction of Orotavo,\\r\\nAmygdala, the Upland Meadows of Anantarivo, and the Marshes of Sonaput.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     THIS Uninhabited Island\\r\\n       Is off Cape Gardafui,\\r\\n     By the Beaches of Socotra\\r\\n       And the Pink Arabian Sea:\\r\\n     But it’s hot--too hot from Suez\\r\\n       For the likes of you and me\\r\\n         Ever to go\\r\\n         In a P. and O.\\r\\n     And call on the Cake-Parsee!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the days when everybody started fair, Best Beloved, the Leopard lived\\r\\nin a place called the High Veldt. ‘Member it wasn’t the Low Veldt, or\\r\\nthe Bush Veldt, or the Sour Veldt, but the ‘sclusively bare, hot, shiny\\r\\nHigh Veldt, where there was sand and sandy-coloured rock and ‘sclusively\\r\\ntufts of sandy-yellowish grass. The Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland\\r\\nand the Koodoo and the Hartebeest lived there; and they were ‘sclusively\\r\\nsandy-yellow-brownish all over; but the Leopard, he was the ‘sclusivest\\r\\nsandiest-yellowish-brownest of them all--a greyish-yellowish\\r\\ncatty-shaped kind of beast, and he matched the ‘sclusively\\r\\nyellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the High Veldt to one hair. This\\r\\nwas very bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and the rest of them; for\\r\\nhe would lie down by a ‘sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish stone or\\r\\nclump of grass, and when the Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland or the\\r\\nKoodoo or the Bush-Buck or the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise them\\r\\nout of their jumpsome lives. He would indeed! And, also, there was an\\r\\nEthiopian with bows and arrows (a ‘sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish\\r\\nman he was then), who lived on the High Veldt with the Leopard; and the\\r\\ntwo used to hunt together--the Ethiopian with his bows and arrows, and\\r\\nthe Leopard ‘sclusively with his teeth and claws--till the Giraffe and\\r\\nthe Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga and all the rest of them didn’t\\r\\nknow which way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn’t indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a long time--things lived for ever so long in those days--they\\r\\nlearned to avoid anything that looked like a Leopard or an Ethiopian;\\r\\nand bit by bit--the Giraffe began it, because his legs were the\\r\\nlongest--they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled for days\\r\\nand days and days till they came to a great forest, ‘sclusively full of\\r\\ntrees and bushes and stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows, and there\\r\\nthey hid: and after another long time, what with standing half in the\\r\\nshade and half out of it, and what with the slippery-slidy shadows of\\r\\nthe trees falling on them, the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew\\r\\nstripy, and the Eland and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey\\r\\nlines on their backs like bark on a tree trunk; and so, though you could\\r\\nhear them and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only\\r\\nwhen you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the\\r\\n‘sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the Leopard and\\r\\nthe Ethiopian ran about over the ‘sclusively greyish-yellowish-reddish\\r\\nHigh Veldt outside, wondering where all their breakfasts and their\\r\\ndinners and their teas had gone. At last they were so hungry that they\\r\\nate rats and beetles and rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian,\\r\\nand then they had the Big Tummy-ache, both together; and then they met\\r\\nBaviaan--the dog-headed, barking Baboon, who is Quite the Wisest Animal\\r\\nin All South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid Leopard to Baviaan (and it was a very hot day), ‘Where has all the\\r\\ngame gone?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Baviaan winked. He knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid the Ethiopian to Baviaan, ‘Can you tell me the present habitat\\r\\nof the aboriginal Fauna?’ (That meant just the same thing, but the\\r\\nEthiopian always used long words. He was a grown-up.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Baviaan winked. He knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Baviaan, ‘The game has gone into other spots; and my advice to\\r\\nyou, Leopard, is to go into other spots as soon as you can.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Ethiopian said, ‘That is all very fine, but I wish to know\\r\\nwhither the aboriginal Fauna has migrated.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Baviaan, ‘The aboriginal Fauna has joined the aboriginal Flora\\r\\nbecause it was high time for a change; and my advice to you, Ethiopian,\\r\\nis to change as soon as you can.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat puzzled the Leopard and the Ethiopian, but they set off to look for\\r\\nthe aboriginal Flora, and presently, after ever so many days, they saw\\r\\na great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks all ‘sclusively speckled\\r\\nand sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and slashed and hatched\\r\\nand cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud, and you will\\r\\nsee how very shadowy the forest must have been.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What is this,’ said the Leopard, ‘that is so ‘sclusively dark, and yet\\r\\nso full of little pieces of light?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t know, said the Ethiopian, ‘but it ought to be the aboriginal\\r\\nFlora. I can smell Giraffe, and I can hear Giraffe, but I can’t see\\r\\nGiraffe.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s curious,’ said the Leopard. ‘I suppose it is because we have\\r\\njust come in out of the sunshine. I can smell Zebra, and I can hear\\r\\nZebra, but I can’t see Zebra.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Wait a bit, said the Ethiopian. ‘It’s a long time since we’ve hunted\\r\\n‘em. Perhaps we’ve forgotten what they were like.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Fiddle!’ said the Leopard. ‘I remember them perfectly on the High\\r\\nVeldt, especially their marrow-bones. Giraffe is about seventeen feet\\r\\nhigh, of a ‘sclusively fulvous golden-yellow from head to heel; and\\r\\nZebra is about four and a half feet high, of a’sclusively grey-fawn\\r\\ncolour from head to heel.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Umm, said the Ethiopian, looking into the speckly-spickly shadows of\\r\\nthe aboriginal Flora-forest. ‘Then they ought to show up in this dark\\r\\nplace like ripe bananas in a smokehouse.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they didn’t. The Leopard and the Ethiopian hunted all day; and\\r\\nthough they could smell them and hear them, they never saw one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘For goodness’ sake,’ said the Leopard at tea-time, ‘let us wait till it\\r\\ngets dark. This daylight hunting is a perfect scandal.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they waited till dark, and then the Leopard heard something breathing\\r\\nsniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through the branches, and\\r\\nhe jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra, and it felt like Zebra,\\r\\nand when he knocked it down it kicked like Zebra, but he couldn’t see\\r\\nit. So he said, ‘Be quiet, O you person without any form. I am going to\\r\\nsit on your head till morning, because there is something about you that\\r\\nI don’t understand.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he heard a grunt and a crash and a scramble, and the Ethiopian\\r\\ncalled out, ‘I’ve caught a thing that I can’t see. It smells like\\r\\nGiraffe, and it kicks like Giraffe, but it hasn’t any form.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t you trust it,’ said the Leopard. ‘Sit on its head till the\\r\\nmorning--same as me. They haven’t any form--any of ‘em.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down on them hard till bright morning-time, and then Leopard\\r\\nsaid, ‘What have you at your end of the table, Brother?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ethiopian scratched his head and said, ‘It ought to be ‘sclusively a\\r\\nrich fulvous orange-tawny from head to heel, and it ought to be Giraffe;\\r\\nbut it is covered all over with chestnut blotches. What have you at your\\r\\nend of the table, Brother?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Leopard scratched his head and said, ‘It ought to be ‘sclusively\\r\\na delicate greyish-fawn, and it ought to be Zebra; but it is covered\\r\\nall over with black and purple stripes. What in the world have you been\\r\\ndoing to yourself, Zebra? Don’t you know that if you were on the High\\r\\nVeldt I could see you ten miles off? You haven’t any form.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said the Zebra, ‘but this isn’t the High Veldt. Can’t you see?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I can now,’ said the Leopard. ‘But I couldn’t all yesterday. How is it\\r\\ndone?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Let us up,’ said the Zebra, ‘and we will show you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey let the Zebra and the Giraffe get up; and Zebra moved away to some\\r\\nlittle thorn-bushes where the sunlight fell all stripy, and Giraffe\\r\\nmoved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all blotchy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now watch,’ said the Zebra and the Giraffe. ‘This is the way it’s done.\\r\\nOne--two--three! And where’s your breakfast?’\\r\\n\\r\\nLeopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but all they could see were stripy\\r\\nshadows and blotched shadows in the forest, but never a sign of Zebra\\r\\nand Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden themselves in the\\r\\nshadowy forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Hi! Hi!’ said the Ethiopian. ‘That’s a trick worth learning. Take a\\r\\nlesson by it, Leopard. You show up in this dark place like a bar of soap\\r\\nin a coal-scuttle.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ho! Ho!’ said the Leopard. ‘Would it surprise you very much to know\\r\\nthat you show up in this dark place like a mustard-plaster on a sack of\\r\\ncoals?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, calling names won’t catch dinner, said the Ethiopian. ‘The long\\r\\nand the little of it is that we don’t match our backgrounds. I’m going\\r\\nto take Baviaan’s advice. He told me I ought to change; and as I’ve\\r\\nnothing to change except my skin I’m going to change that.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What to?’ said the Leopard, tremendously excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘To a nice working blackish-brownish colour, with a little purple in\\r\\nit, and touches of slaty-blue. It will be the very thing for hiding in\\r\\nhollows and behind trees.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he changed his skin then and there, and the Leopard was more excited\\r\\nthan ever; he had never seen a man change his skin before.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But what about me?’ he said, when the Ethiopian had worked his last\\r\\nlittle finger into his fine new black skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You take Baviaan’s advice too. He told you to go into spots.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘So I did,’ said the Leopard. I went into other spots as fast as I\\r\\ncould. I went into this spot with you, and a lot of good it has done\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh,’ said the Ethiopian, ‘Baviaan didn’t mean spots in South Africa. He\\r\\nmeant spots on your skin.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s the use of that?’ said the Leopard.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Think of Giraffe,’ said the Ethiopian. ‘Or if you prefer stripes,\\r\\nthink of Zebra. They find their spots and stripes give them per-feet\\r\\nsatisfaction.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Umm,’ said the Leopard. ‘I wouldn’t look like Zebra--not for ever so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, make up your mind,’ said the Ethiopian, ‘because I’d hate to\\r\\ngo hunting without you, but I must if you insist on looking like a\\r\\nsun-flower against a tarred fence.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll take spots, then,’ said the Leopard; ‘but don’t make ‘em too\\r\\nvulgar-big. I wouldn’t look like Giraffe--not for ever so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll make ‘em with the tips of my fingers,’ said the Ethiopian.\\r\\n‘There’s plenty of black left on my skin still. Stand over!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together (there was plenty\\r\\nof black left on his new skin still) and pressed them all over the\\r\\nLeopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little\\r\\nblack marks, all close together. You can see them on any Leopard’s skin\\r\\nyou like, Best Beloved. Sometimes the fingers slipped and the marks got\\r\\na little blurred; but if you look closely at any Leopard now you will\\r\\nsee that there are always five spots--off five fat black finger-tips.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now you are a beauty!’ said the Ethiopian. ‘You can lie out on the bare\\r\\nground and look like a heap of pebbles. You can lie out on the naked\\r\\nrocks and look like a piece of pudding-stone. You can lie out on a leafy\\r\\nbranch and look like sunshine sifting through the leaves; and you\\r\\ncan lie right across the centre of a path and look like nothing in\\r\\nparticular. Think of that and purr!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But if I’m all this,’ said the Leopard, ‘why didn’t you go spotty too?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, plain black’s best for a nigger,’ said the Ethiopian. ‘Now come\\r\\nalong and we’ll see if we can’t get even with Mr. One-Two-Three Where’s\\r\\nyour Breakfast!’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went away and lived happily ever afterward, Best Beloved. That\\r\\nis all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, now and then you will hear grown-ups say, ‘Can the Ethiopian change\\r\\nhis skin or the Leopard his spots?’ I don’t think even grown-ups would\\r\\nkeep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian\\r\\nhadn’t done it once--do you? But they will never do it again, Best\\r\\nBeloved. They are quite contented as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   I AM the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in most wise tones,\\r\\n   ‘Let us melt into the landscape--just us two by our lones.’\\r\\n   People have come--in a carriage--calling. But Mummy is there....\\r\\n   Yes, I can go if you take me--Nurse says she don’t care.\\r\\n   Let’s go up to the pig-sties and sit on the farmyard rails!\\r\\n   Let’s say things to the bunnies, and watch ‘em skitter their tails!\\r\\n   Let’s--oh, anything, daddy, so long as it’s you and me,\\r\\n   And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!\\r\\n   Here’s your boots (I’ve brought ‘em), and here’s your cap and stick,\\r\\n   And here’s your pipe and tobacco. Oh, come along out of it--quick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELEPHANT’S CHILD\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no\\r\\ntrunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he\\r\\ncould wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn’t pick up things\\r\\nwith it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant’s\\r\\nChild--who was full of ‘satiable curtiosity, and that means he asked\\r\\never so many questions. And he lived in Africa, and he filled all Africa\\r\\nwith his ‘satiable curtiosities. He asked his tall aunt, the Ostrich,\\r\\nwhy her tail-feathers grew just so, and his tall aunt the Ostrich\\r\\nspanked him with her hard, hard claw. He asked his tall uncle, the\\r\\nGiraffe, what made his skin spotty, and his tall uncle, the Giraffe,\\r\\nspanked him with his hard, hard hoof. And still he was full of ‘satiable\\r\\ncurtiosity! He asked his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, why her eyes were\\r\\nred, and his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad,\\r\\nbroad hoof; and he asked his hairy uncle, the Baboon, why melons tasted\\r\\njust so, and his hairy uncle, the Baboon, spanked him with his hairy,\\r\\nhairy paw. And still he was full of ‘satiable curtiosity! He asked\\r\\nquestions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or\\r\\ntouched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was\\r\\nfull of ‘satiable curtiosity!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this\\r\\n‘satiable Elephant’s Child asked a new fine question that he had never\\r\\nasked before. He asked, ‘What does the Crocodile have for dinner?’ Then\\r\\neverybody said, ‘Hush!’ in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him\\r\\nimmediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, when that was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird sitting\\r\\nin the middle of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said, ‘My father has\\r\\nspanked me, and my mother has spanked me; all my aunts and uncles have\\r\\nspanked me for my ‘satiable curtiosity; and still I want to know what\\r\\nthe Crocodile has for dinner!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, ‘Go to the banks of the\\r\\ngreat grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees,\\r\\nand find out.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very next morning, when there was nothing left of the Equinoxes,\\r\\nbecause the Precession had preceded according to precedent, this\\r\\n‘satiable Elephant’s Child took a hundred pounds of bananas (the little\\r\\nshort red kind), and a hundred pounds of sugar-cane (the long purple\\r\\nkind), and seventeen melons (the greeny-crackly kind), and said to all\\r\\nhis dear families, ‘Goodbye. I am going to the great grey-green, greasy\\r\\nLimpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to find out what the\\r\\nCrocodile has for dinner.’ And they all spanked him once more for luck,\\r\\nthough he asked them most politely to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went away, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating\\r\\nmelons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not pick it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went from Graham’s Town to Kimberley, and from Kimberley to Khama’s\\r\\nCountry, and from Khama’s Country he went east by north, eating melons\\r\\nall the time, till at last he came to the banks of the great grey-green,\\r\\ngreasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, precisely as\\r\\nKolokolo Bird had said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you must know and understand, O Best Beloved, that till that very\\r\\nweek, and day, and hour, and minute, this ‘satiable Elephant’s Child had\\r\\nnever seen a Crocodile, and did not know what one was like. It was all\\r\\nhis ‘satiable curtiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing that he found was a Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake curled\\r\\nround a rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child most politely, ‘but have you seen\\r\\nsuch a thing as a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Have I seen a Crocodile?’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, in a\\r\\nvoice of dretful scorn. ‘What will you ask me next?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child, ‘but could you kindly tell me\\r\\nwhat he has for dinner?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake uncoiled himself very quickly\\r\\nfrom the rock, and spanked the Elephant’s Child with his scalesome,\\r\\nflailsome tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That is odd,’ said the Elephant’s Child, ‘because my father and my\\r\\nmother, and my uncle and my aunt, not to mention my other aunt, the\\r\\nHippopotamus, and my other uncle, the Baboon, have all spanked me for my\\r\\n‘satiable curtiosity--and I suppose this is the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he said good-bye very politely to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake,\\r\\nand helped to coil him up on the rock again, and went on, a little warm,\\r\\nbut not at all astonished, eating melons, and throwing the rind about,\\r\\nbecause he could not pick it up, till he trod on what he thought was\\r\\na log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo\\r\\nRiver, all set about with fever-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was really the Crocodile, O Best Beloved, and the Crocodile\\r\\nwinked one eye--like this!\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child most politely, ‘but do you happen\\r\\nto have seen a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Crocodile winked the other eye, and lifted half his tail out of\\r\\nthe mud; and the Elephant’s Child stepped back most politely, because he\\r\\ndid not wish to be spanked again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come hither, Little One,’ said the Crocodile. ‘Why do you ask such\\r\\nthings?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child most politely, ‘but my father has\\r\\nspanked me, my mother has spanked me, not to mention my tall aunt, the\\r\\nOstrich, and my tall uncle, the Giraffe, who can kick ever so hard, as\\r\\nwell as my broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and my hairy uncle, the Baboon,\\r\\nand including the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, with the scalesome,\\r\\nflailsome tail, just up the bank, who spanks harder than any of them;\\r\\nand so, if it’s quite all the same to you, I don’t want to be spanked\\r\\nany more.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come hither, Little One,’ said the Crocodile, ‘for I am the Crocodile,’\\r\\nand he wept crocodile-tears to show it was quite true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Elephant’s Child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled\\r\\ndown on the bank and said, ‘You are the very person I have been looking\\r\\nfor all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for\\r\\ndinner?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come hither, Little One,’ said the Crocodile, ‘and I’ll whisper.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Elephant’s Child put his head down close to the Crocodile’s\\r\\nmusky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose,\\r\\nwhich up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger\\r\\nthan a boot, though much more useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I think, said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like\\r\\nthis--‘I think to-day I will begin with Elephant’s Child!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant’s Child was much annoyed, and he\\r\\nsaid, speaking through his nose, like this, ‘Led go! You are hurtig be!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and\\r\\nsaid, ‘My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly,\\r\\npull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in\\r\\nthe large-pattern leather ulster’ (and by this he meant the Crocodile)\\r\\n‘will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack\\r\\nRobinson.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Elephant’s Child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled,\\r\\nand pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile\\r\\nfloundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his\\r\\ntail, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Elephant’s Child’s nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant’s\\r\\nChild spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and\\r\\npulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his\\r\\ntail like an oar, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each\\r\\npull the Elephant’s Child’s nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him\\r\\nhijjus!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Elephant’s Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through\\r\\nhis nose, which was now nearly five feet long, ‘This is too butch for\\r\\nbe!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and\\r\\nknotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant’s Child’s\\r\\nhind legs, and said, ‘Rash and inexperienced traveller, we will now\\r\\nseriously devote ourselves to a little high tension, because if we do\\r\\nnot, it is my impression that yonder self-propelling man-of-war with\\r\\nthe armour-plated upper deck’ (and by this, O Best Beloved, he meant the\\r\\nCrocodile), ‘will permanently vitiate your future career.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the way all Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he pulled, and the Elephant’s Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled;\\r\\nbut the Elephant’s Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled\\r\\nhardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant’s Child’s nose\\r\\nwith a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Elephant’s Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he\\r\\nwas careful to say ‘Thank you’ to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and\\r\\nnext he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool\\r\\nbanana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo to\\r\\ncool.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What are you doing that for?’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child, ‘but my nose is badly out of\\r\\nshape, and I am waiting for it to shrink.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then you will have to wait a long time, said the\\r\\nBi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. ‘Some people do not know what is good for\\r\\nthem.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Elephant’s Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to\\r\\nshrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint.\\r\\nFor, O Best Beloved, you will see and understand that the Crocodile\\r\\nhad pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all Elephants have\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder,\\r\\nand before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that\\r\\nfly dead with the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Vantage number one!’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. ‘You\\r\\ncouldn’t have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little\\r\\nnow.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he thought what he was doing the Elephant’s Child put out his\\r\\ntrunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his\\r\\nfore-legs, and stuffed it into his own mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Vantage number two!’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. ‘You\\r\\ncouldn’t have done that with a mear-smear nose. Don’t you think the sun\\r\\nis very hot here?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It is,’ said the Elephant’s Child, and before he thought what he was\\r\\ndoing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great\\r\\ngrey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a\\r\\ncool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Vantage number three!’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. ‘You\\r\\ncouldn’t have done that with a mere-smear nose. Now how do you feel\\r\\nabout being spanked again?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Scuse me,’ said the Elephant’s Child, ‘but I should not like it at\\r\\nall.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How would you like to spank somebody?’ said the\\r\\nBi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I should like it very much indeed,’ said the Elephant’s Child.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, ‘you will find that new\\r\\nnose of yours very useful to spank people with.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Thank you,’ said the Elephant’s Child, ‘I’ll remember that; and now I\\r\\nthink I’ll go home to all my dear families and try.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Elephant’s Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking\\r\\nhis trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree,\\r\\ninstead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass\\r\\nhe plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he\\r\\nused to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree\\r\\nand used it as fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy\\r\\nmud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through\\r\\nAfrica he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than\\r\\nseveral brass bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus (she was\\r\\nno relation of his), and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the\\r\\nBi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk.\\r\\nThe rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on\\r\\nhis way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy Pachyderm.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up\\r\\nhis trunk and said, ‘How do you do?’ They were very glad to see him,\\r\\nand immediately said, ‘Come here and be spanked for your ‘satiable\\r\\ncurtiosity.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Pooh,’ said the Elephant’s Child. ‘I don’t think you peoples know\\r\\nanything about spanking; but I do, and I’ll show you.’ Then he uncurled\\r\\nhis trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O Bananas!’ said they, ‘where did you learn that trick, and what have\\r\\nyou done to your nose?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great\\r\\ngrey-green, greasy Limpopo River,’ said the Elephant’s Child. ‘I asked\\r\\nhim what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It looks very ugly,’ said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It does,’ said the Elephant’s Child. ‘But it’s very useful,’ and he\\r\\npicked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him\\r\\ninto a hornet’s nest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen that bad Elephant’s Child spanked all his dear families for a long\\r\\ntime, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out\\r\\nhis tall Ostrich aunt’s tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the\\r\\nGiraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he\\r\\nshouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her\\r\\near when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any\\r\\none touch Kolokolo Bird.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one\\r\\nby one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo\\r\\nRiver, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the\\r\\nCrocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody any more; and ever\\r\\nsince that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see,\\r\\nbesides all those that you won’t, have trunks precisely like the trunk\\r\\nof the ‘satiable Elephant’s Child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     I Keep six honest serving-men:\\r\\n       (They taught me all I knew)\\r\\n     Their names are What and Where and When\\r\\n       And How and Why and Who.\\r\\n     I send them over land and sea,\\r\\n       I send them east and west;\\r\\n     But after they have worked for me,\\r\\n       I give them all a rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n     I let them rest from nine till five.\\r\\n       For I am busy then,\\r\\n     As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,\\r\\n       For they are hungry men:\\r\\n     But different folk have different views:\\r\\n       I know a person small--\\r\\n     She keeps ten million serving-men,\\r\\n       Who get no rest at all!\\r\\n     She sends ‘em abroad on her own affairs,\\r\\n       From the second she opens her eyes--\\r\\n     One million Hows, two million Wheres,\\r\\n       And seven million Whys!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SING-SONG OF OLD MAN KANGAROO\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him, but a Different\\r\\nAnimal with four short legs. He was grey and he was woolly, and\\r\\nhis pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop in the middle of\\r\\nAustralia, and he went to the Little God Nqa.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, ‘Make me different from\\r\\nall other animals by five this afternoon.’\\r\\n\\r\\nUp jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted, ‘Go away!’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced\\r\\non a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Middle\\r\\nGod Nquing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Nquing at eight after breakfast, saying, ‘Make me different\\r\\nfrom all other animals; make me, also, wonderfully popular by five this\\r\\nafternoon.’\\r\\n\\r\\nUp jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted, ‘Go away!’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced\\r\\non a sandbank in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Big God\\r\\nNqong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time, saying, ‘Make me different\\r\\nfrom all other animals; make me popular and wonderfully run after by\\r\\nfive this afternoon.’\\r\\n\\r\\nUp jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted, ‘Yes, I\\r\\nwill!’\\r\\n\\r\\nNqong called Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusty in the\\r\\nsunshine, and showed him Kangaroo. Nqong said, ‘Dingo! Wake up, Dingo!\\r\\nDo you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit? He wants to be popular\\r\\nand very truly run after. Dingo, make him SO!’\\r\\n\\r\\nUp jumped Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--and said, ‘What, that cat-rabbit?’\\r\\n\\r\\nOff ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a\\r\\ncoal-scuttle,--ran after Kangaroo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOff went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, O Beloved of mine, ends the first part of the tale!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ran through the desert; he ran through the mountains; he ran through\\r\\nthe salt-pans; he ran through the reed-beds; he ran through the blue\\r\\ngums; he ran through the spinifex; he ran till his front legs ached.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a\\r\\nrat-trap, never getting nearer, never getting farther,--ran after\\r\\nKangaroo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill ran Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo. He ran through the ti-trees; he\\r\\nran through the mulga; he ran through the long grass; he ran through the\\r\\nshort grass; he ran through the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; he ran\\r\\ntill his hind legs ached.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, grinning like\\r\\na horse-collar, never getting nearer, never getting farther; and they\\r\\ncame to the Wollgong River.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there wasn’t any bridge, and there wasn’t any ferry-boat, and\\r\\nKangaroo didn’t know how to get over; so he stood on his legs and\\r\\nhopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hopped through the Flinders; he hopped through the Cinders; he\\r\\nhopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia. He hopped like a\\r\\nKangaroo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst he hopped one yard; then he hopped three yards; then he hopped\\r\\nfive yards; his legs growing stronger; his legs growing longer. He\\r\\nhadn’t any time for rest or refreshment, and he wanted them very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--very much bewildered, very much\\r\\nhungry, and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man\\r\\nKangaroo hop.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor he hopped like a cricket; like a pea in a saucepan; or a new rubber\\r\\nball on a nursery floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tucked up his front legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he stuck out\\r\\nhis tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped through the\\r\\nDarling Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had to!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill ran Dingo--Tired-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, very much\\r\\nbewildered, and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old Man\\r\\nKangaroo stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans, and said, ‘It’s five\\r\\no’clock.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDown sat Dingo--Poor Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusky in the sunshine;\\r\\nhung out his tongue and howled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown sat Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo--stuck out his tail like a\\r\\nmilking-stool behind him, and said, ‘Thank goodness that’s finished!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Nqong, who is always a gentleman, ‘Why aren’t you grateful to\\r\\nYellow-Dog Dingo? Why don’t you thank him for all he has done for you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Kangaroo--Tired Old Kangaroo--He’s chased me out of the homes\\r\\nof my childhood; he’s chased me out of my regular meal-times; he’s\\r\\naltered my shape so I’ll never get it back; and he’s played Old Scratch\\r\\nwith my legs.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Nqong, ‘Perhaps I’m mistaken, but didn’t you ask me to make\\r\\nyou different from all other animals, as well as to make you very truly\\r\\nsought after? And now it is five o’clock.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Kangaroo. ‘I wish that I hadn’t. I thought you would do it\\r\\nby charms and incantations, but this is a practical joke.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Joke!’ said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums. ‘Say that again and\\r\\nI’ll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Kangaroo. ‘I must apologise. Legs are legs, and you\\r\\nneedn’t alter ‘em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to explain to\\r\\nYour Lordliness that I’ve had nothing to eat since morning, and I’m very\\r\\nempty indeed.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo,--‘I am just in the same situation.\\r\\nI’ve made him different from all other animals; but what may I have for\\r\\nmy tea?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan, ‘Come and ask me about it\\r\\ntomorrow, because I’m going to wash.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they were left in the middle of Australia, Old Man Kangaroo and\\r\\nYellow-Dog Dingo, and each said, ‘That’s your fault.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     THIS is the mouth-filling song\\r\\n     Of the race that was run by a Boomer,\\r\\n     Run in a single burst--only event of its kind--\\r\\n     Started by big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma,\\r\\n     Old Man Kangaroo first: Yellow-Dog Dingo behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Kangaroo bounded away,\\r\\n     His back-legs working like pistons--\\r\\n     Bounded from morning till dark,\\r\\n     Twenty-five feet to a bound.\\r\\n     Yellow-Dog Dingo lay\\r\\n     Like a yellow cloud in the distance--\\r\\n     Much too busy to bark.\\r\\n     My! but they covered the ground!\\r\\n\\r\\n     Nobody knows where they went,\\r\\n     Or followed the track that they flew in,\\r\\n     For that Continent\\r\\n     Hadn’t been given a name.\\r\\n     They ran thirty degrees,\\r\\n     From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin\\r\\n     (Look at the Atlas, please),\\r\\n     And they ran back as they came.\\r\\n\\r\\n     S’posing you could trot\\r\\n     From Adelaide to the Pacific,\\r\\n     For an afternoon’s run\\r\\n     Half what these gentlemen did\\r\\n     You would feel rather hot,\\r\\n     But your legs would develop terrific--\\r\\n     Yes, my importunate son,\\r\\n     You’d be a Marvellous Kid!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE ARMADILLOS\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS, O Best Beloved, is another story of the High and Far-Off Times.\\r\\nIn the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog, and\\r\\nhe lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and\\r\\nthings. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid Tortoise, who lived on the\\r\\nbanks of the turbid Amazon, eating green lettuces and things. And so\\r\\nthat was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut also, and at the same time, in those High and Far-Off Times, there\\r\\nwas a Painted Jaguar, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon\\r\\ntoo; and he ate everything that he could catch. When he could not catch\\r\\ndeer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles; and when he could not\\r\\ncatch frogs and beetles he went to his Mother Jaguar, and she told him\\r\\nhow to eat hedgehogs and tortoises.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said to him ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, ‘My son,\\r\\nwhen you find a Hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he\\r\\nwill uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his\\r\\nshell with your paw.’ And so that was all right, Best Beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne beautiful night on the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted Jaguar\\r\\nfound Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise sitting under the\\r\\ntrunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away, and so Stickly-Prickly\\r\\ncurled himself up into a ball, because he was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid\\r\\nTortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would\\r\\ngo, because he was a Tortoise; and so that was all right, Best Beloved.\\r\\nDo you see?\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now attend to me,’ said Painted Jaguar, ‘because this is very\\r\\nimportant. My mother said that when I meet a Hedgehog I am to drop him\\r\\ninto the water and then he will uncoil, and when I meet a Tortoise I am\\r\\nto scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which of you is Hedgehog\\r\\nand which is Tortoise? because, to save my spots, I can’t tell.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?’ said Stickly-Prickly\\r\\nHedgehog. ‘Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you uncoil a\\r\\nTortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop, and when you paw\\r\\na Hedgehog you must drop him on the shell.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?’ said Slow-and-Solid\\r\\nTortoise. ‘Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you water a\\r\\nHedgehog you must drop him into your paw, and when you meet a Tortoise\\r\\nyou must shell him till he uncoils.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t think it was at all like that,’ said Painted Jaguar, but he\\r\\nfelt a little puzzled; ‘but, please, say it again more distinctly.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘When you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a Hedgehog,’ said\\r\\nStickly-Prickly. ‘Remember that, because it’s important.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But,’ said the Tortoise, ‘when you paw your meat you drop it into a\\r\\nTortoise with a scoop. Why can’t you understand?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are making my spots ache,’ said Painted Jaguar; ‘and besides, I\\r\\ndidn’t want your advice at all. I only wanted to know which of you is\\r\\nHedgehog and which is Tortoise.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I shan’t tell you,’ said Stickly-Prickly, ‘but you can scoop me out of\\r\\nmy shell if you like.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Aha!’ said Painted Jaguar. ‘Now I know you’re Tortoise. You thought I\\r\\nwouldn’t! Now I will.’ Painted Jaguar darted out his paddy-paw just as\\r\\nStickly-Prickly curled himself up, and of course Jaguar’s paddy-paw was\\r\\njust filled with prickles. Worse than that, he knocked Stickly-Prickly\\r\\naway and away into the woods and the bushes, where it was too dark to\\r\\nfind him. Then he put his paddy-paw into his mouth, and of course the\\r\\nprickles hurt him worse than ever. As soon as he could speak he said,\\r\\n‘Now I know he isn’t Tortoise at all. But’--and then he scratched\\r\\nhis head with his un-prickly paw--‘how do I know that this other is\\r\\nTortoise?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But I am Tortoise,’ said Slow-and-Solid. Your mother was quite right.\\r\\nShe said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.\\r\\nBegin.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You didn’t say she said that a minute ago, said Painted Jaguar, sucking\\r\\nthe prickles out of his paddy-paw. ‘You said she said something quite\\r\\ndifferent.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, suppose you say that I said that she said something quite\\r\\ndifferent, I don’t see that it makes any difference; because if she said\\r\\nwhat you said I said she said, it’s just the same as if I said what she\\r\\nsaid she said. On the other hand, if you think she said that you were to\\r\\nuncoil me with a scoop, instead of pawing me into drops with a shell, I\\r\\ncan’t help that, can I?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my paw,’\\r\\nsaid Painted Jaguar.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you’ll think again you’ll find that I didn’t say anything of the\\r\\nkind. I said that your mother said that you were to scoop me out of my\\r\\nshell,’ said Slow-and-Solid.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What will happen if I do?’ said the Jaguar most sniffily and most\\r\\ncautious.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t know, because I’ve never been scooped out of my shell before;\\r\\nbut I tell you truly, if you want to see me swim away you’ve only got to\\r\\ndrop me into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t believe it,’ said Painted Jaguar. ‘You’ve mixed up all the\\r\\nthings my mother told me to do with the things that you asked me whether\\r\\nI was sure that she didn’t say, till I don’t know whether I’m on my\\r\\nhead or my painted tail; and now you come and tell me something I can\\r\\nunderstand, and it makes me more mixy than before. My mother told me\\r\\nthat I was to drop one of you two into the water, and as you seem so\\r\\nanxious to be dropped I think you don’t want to be dropped. So jump into\\r\\nthe turbid Amazon and be quick about it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I warn you that your Mummy won’t be pleased. Don’t tell her I didn’t\\r\\ntell you,’ said Slow-Solid.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you say another word about what my mother said--’ the Jaguar\\r\\nanswered, but he had not finished the sentence before Slow-and-Solid\\r\\nquietly dived into the turbid Amazon, swam under water for a long way,\\r\\nand came out on the bank where Stickly-Prickly was waiting for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That was a very narrow escape,’ said Stickly-Prickly. ‘I don’t rib\\r\\nPainted Jaguar. What did you tell him that you were?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I told him truthfully that I was a truthful Tortoise, but he wouldn’t\\r\\nbelieve it, and he made me jump into the river to see if I was, and I\\r\\nwas, and he is surprised. Now he’s gone to tell his Mummy. Listen to\\r\\nhim!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could hear Painted Jaguar roaring up and down among the trees and\\r\\nthe bushes by the side of the turbid Amazon, till his Mummy came.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Son, son!’ said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her\\r\\ntail, ‘what have you been doing that you shouldn’t have done?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped out of\\r\\nits shell with my paw, and my paw is full of per-ickles,’ said Painted\\r\\nJaguar.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Son, son!’ said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her\\r\\ntail, ‘by the prickles in your paddy-paw I see that that must have been\\r\\na Hedgehog. You should have dropped him into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I did that to the other thing; and he said he was a Tortoise, and I\\r\\ndidn’t believe him, and it was quite true, and he has dived under the\\r\\nturbid Amazon, and he won’t come up again, and I haven’t anything at all\\r\\nto eat, and I think we had better find lodgings somewhere else. They are\\r\\ntoo clever on the turbid Amazon for poor me!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Son, son!’ said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving\\r\\nher tail, ‘now attend to me and remember what I say. A Hedgehog curls\\r\\nhimself up into a ball and his prickles stick out every which way at\\r\\nonce. By this you may know the Hedgehog.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t like this old lady one little bit,’ said Stickly-Prickly, under\\r\\nthe shadow of a large leaf. ‘I wonder what else she knows?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A Tortoise can’t curl himself up,’ Mother Jaguar went on, ever so many\\r\\ntimes, graciously waving her tail. ‘He only draws his head and legs into\\r\\nhis shell. By this you may know the tortoise.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t like this old lady at all--at all,’ said Slow-and-Solid\\r\\nTortoise. ‘Even Painted Jaguar can’t forget those directions. It’s a\\r\\ngreat pity that you can’t swim, Stickly-Prickly.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t talk to me,’ said Stickly-Prickly. ‘Just think how much better\\r\\nit would be if you could curl up. This is a mess! Listen to Painted\\r\\nJaguar.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPainted Jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid Amazon sucking\\r\\nprickles out of his Paws and saying to himself--\\r\\n\\r\\n  ‘Can’t curl, but can swim--\\r\\n  Slow-Solid, that’s him!\\r\\n  Curls up, but can’t swim--\\r\\n  Stickly-Prickly, that’s him!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He’ll never forget that this month of Sundays,’ said Stickly-Prickly.\\r\\n‘Hold up my chin, Slow-and-Solid. I’m going to try to learn to swim. It\\r\\nmay be useful.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Slow-and-Solid; and he held up Stickly-Prickly’s chin,\\r\\nwhile Stickly-Prickly kicked in the waters of the turbid Amazon.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You’ll make a fine swimmer yet,’ said Slow-and-Solid. ‘Now, if you can\\r\\nunlace my back-plates a little, I’ll see what I can do towards curling\\r\\nup. It may be useful.’\\r\\n\\r\\nStickly-Prickly helped to unlace Tortoise’s back-plates, so that by\\r\\ntwisting and straining Slow-and-Solid actually managed to curl up a\\r\\ntiddy wee bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Stickly-Prickly; ‘but I shouldn’t do any more just\\r\\nnow. It’s making you black in the face. Kindly lead me into the water\\r\\nonce again and I’ll practice that side-stroke which you say is so easy.’\\r\\nAnd so Stickly-Prickly practiced, and Slow-Solid swam alongside.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Slow-and-Solid. ‘A little more practice will make you\\r\\na regular whale. Now, if I may trouble you to unlace my back and front\\r\\nplates two holes more, I’ll try that fascinating bend that you say is so\\r\\neasy. Won’t Painted Jaguar be surprised!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Stickly-Prickly, all wet from the turbid Amazon. ‘I\\r\\ndeclare, I shouldn’t know you from one of my own family. Two holes, I\\r\\nthink, you said? A little more expression, please, and don’t grunt quite\\r\\nso much, or Painted Jaguar may hear us. When you’ve finished, I want\\r\\nto try that long dive which you say is so easy. Won’t Painted Jaguar be\\r\\nsurprised!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Stickly-Prickly dived, and Slow-and-Solid dived alongside.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Slow-and-Solid. ‘A leetle more attention to holding\\r\\nyour breath and you will be able to keep house at the bottom of the\\r\\nturbid Amazon. Now I’ll try that exercise of putting my hind legs round\\r\\nmy ears which you say is so peculiarly comfortable. Won’t Painted Jaguar\\r\\nbe surprised!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Excellent!’ said Stickly-Prickly. ‘But it’s straining your back-plates\\r\\na little. They are all overlapping now, instead of lying side by side.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, that’s the result of exercise,’ said Slow-and-Solid. ‘I’ve noticed\\r\\nthat your prickles seem to be melting into one another, and that\\r\\nyou’re growing to look rather more like a pinecone, and less like a\\r\\nchestnut-burr, than you used to.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Am I?’ said Stickly-Prickly. ‘That comes from my soaking in the water.\\r\\nOh, won’t Painted Jaguar be surprised!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on with their exercises, each helping the other, till morning\\r\\ncame; and when the sun was high they rested and dried themselves. Then\\r\\nthey saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Stickly-Prickly,’ said Tortoise after breakfast, ‘I am not what I was\\r\\nyesterday; but I think that I may yet amuse Painted Jaguar.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That was the very thing I was thinking just now,’ said Stickly-Prickly.\\r\\n‘I think scales are a tremendous improvement on prickles--to say nothing\\r\\nof being able to swim. Oh, won’t Painted Jaguar be surprised! Let’s go\\r\\nand find him.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by they found Painted Jaguar, still nursing his paddy-paw that\\r\\nhad been hurt the night before. He was so astonished that he fell three\\r\\ntimes backward over his own painted tail without stopping.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Good morning!’ said Stickly-Prickly. ‘And how is your dear gracious\\r\\nMummy this morning?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘She is quite well, thank you,’ said Painted Jaguar; ‘but you must\\r\\nforgive me if I do not at this precise moment recall your name.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s unkind of you,’ said Stickly-Prickly, ‘seeing that this time\\r\\nyesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But you hadn’t any shell. It was all prickles,’ said Painted Jaguar. ‘I\\r\\nknow it was. Just look at my paw!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You told me to drop into the turbid Amazon and be drowned,’ said\\r\\nSlow-Solid. ‘Why are you so rude and forgetful to-day?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t you remember what your mother told you?’ said Stickly-Prickly,--\\r\\n\\r\\n  ‘Can’t curl, but can swim--\\r\\n  Stickly-Prickly, that’s him!\\r\\n  Curls up, but can’t swim--\\r\\n  Slow-Solid, that’s him!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round Painted\\r\\nJaguar till his eyes turned truly cart-wheels in his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went to fetch his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mother,’ he said, ‘there are two new animals in the woods to-day, and\\r\\nthe one that you said couldn’t swim, swims, and the one that you said\\r\\ncouldn’t curl up, curls; and they’ve gone shares in their prickles, I\\r\\nthink, because both of them are scaly all over, instead of one being\\r\\nsmooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling\\r\\nround and round in circles, and I don’t feel comfy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Son, son!’ said Mother Jaguar ever so many times, graciously waving her\\r\\ntail, ‘a Hedgehog is a Hedgehog, and can’t be anything but a Hedgehog;\\r\\nand a Tortoise is a Tortoise, and can never be anything else.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But it isn’t a Hedgehog, and it isn’t a Tortoise. It’s a little bit of\\r\\nboth, and I don’t know its proper name.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nonsense!’ said Mother Jaguar. ‘Everything has its proper name. I\\r\\nshould call it “Armadillo” till I found out the real one. And I should\\r\\nleave it alone.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Painted Jaguar did as he was told, especially about leaving them\\r\\nalone; but the curious thing is that from that day to this, O Best\\r\\nBeloved, no one on the banks of the turbid Amazon has ever called\\r\\nStickly-Prickly and Slow-Solid anything except Armadillo. There are\\r\\nHedgehogs and Tortoises in other places, of course (there are some in\\r\\nmy garden); but the real old and clever kind, with their scales lying\\r\\nlippety-lappety one over the other, like pine-cone scales, that lived on\\r\\nthe banks of the turbid Amazon in the High and Far-Off Days, are always\\r\\ncalled Armadillos, because they were so clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that; all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?\\r\\n\\r\\n     I’VE never sailed the Amazon,\\r\\n       I’ve never reached Brazil;\\r\\n     But the Don and Magdelana,\\r\\n       They can go there when they will!\\r\\n\\r\\n             Yes, weekly from Southampton,\\r\\n             Great steamers, white and gold,\\r\\n             Go rolling down to Rio\\r\\n             (Roll down--roll down to Rio!)\\r\\n             And I’d like to roll to Rio\\r\\n             Some day before I’m old!\\r\\n\\r\\n     I’ve never seen a Jaguar,\\r\\n       Nor yet an Armadill\\r\\n     O dilloing in his armour,\\r\\n       And I s’pose I never will,\\r\\n\\r\\n             Unless I go to Rio\\r\\n             These wonders to behold--\\r\\n             Roll down--roll down to Rio--\\r\\n             Roll really down to Rio!\\r\\n             Oh, I’d love to roll to Rio\\r\\n             Some day before I’m old!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE FIRST LETTER WAS WRITTEN\\r\\n\\r\\nONCE upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a Jute or an\\r\\nAngle, or even a Dravidian, which he might well have been, Best Beloved,\\r\\nbut never mind why. He was a Primitive, and he lived cavily in a Cave,\\r\\nand he wore very few clothes, and he couldn’t read and he couldn’t write\\r\\nand he didn’t want to, and except when he was hungry he was\\r\\nquite happy. His name was Tegumai Bopsulai, and that means,\\r\\n‘Man-who-does-not-put-his-foot-forward-in-a-hurry’; but we, O Best\\r\\nBeloved, will call him Tegumai, for short. And his wife’s name\\r\\nwas Teshumai Tewindrow, and that means,\\r\\n‘Lady-who-asks-a-very-many-questions’; but we, O Best Beloved, will\\r\\ncall her Teshumai, for short. And his little girl-daughter’s name\\r\\nwas Taffimai Metallumai, and that means,\\r\\n‘Small-person-without-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked’; but I’m\\r\\ngoing to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulai’s Best Beloved and\\r\\nher own Mummy’s Best Beloved, and she was not spanked half as much as\\r\\nwas good for her; and they were all three very happy. As soon as\\r\\nTaffy could run about she went everywhere with her Daddy Tegumai, and\\r\\nsometimes they would not come home to the Cave till they were hungry,\\r\\nand then Teshumai Tewindrow would say, ‘Where in the world have you two\\r\\nbeen to, to get so shocking dirty? Really, my Tegumai, you’re no better\\r\\nthan my Taffy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNow attend and listen!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaver-swamp to the Wagai\\r\\nriver to spear carp-fish for dinner, and Taffy went too. Tegumai’s spear\\r\\nwas made of wood with shark’s teeth at the end, and before he had caught\\r\\nany fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it down\\r\\ntoo hard on the bottom of the river. They were miles and miles from home\\r\\n(of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag), and Tegumai\\r\\nhad forgotten to bring any extra spears.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here’s a pretty kettle of fish!’ said Tegumai. ‘It will take me half\\r\\nthe day to mend this.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There’s your big black spear at home,’ said Taffy. ‘Let me run back to\\r\\nthe Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s too far for your little fat legs,’ said Tegumai. ‘Besides, you\\r\\nmight fall into the beaver-swamp and be drowned. We must make the best\\r\\nof a bad job.’ He sat down and took out a little leather mendy-bag, full\\r\\nof reindeer-sinews and strips of leather, and lumps of bee’s-wax and\\r\\nresin, and began to mend the spear.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaffy sat down too, with her toes in the water and her chin in her\\r\\nhand, and thought very hard. Then she said--‘I say, Daddy, it’s an awful\\r\\nnuisance that you and I don’t know how to write, isn’t it? If we did we\\r\\ncould send a message for the new spear.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Taffy,’ said Tegumai, ‘how often have I told you not to use slang?\\r\\n“Awful” isn’t a pretty word, but it could be a convenience, now you\\r\\nmention it, if we could write home.’\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a Stranger-man came along the river, but he belonged to a\\r\\nfar tribe, the Tewaras, and he did not understand one word of Tegumai’s\\r\\nlanguage. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy, because he had\\r\\na little girl-daughter Of his own at home. Tegumai drew a hank of\\r\\ndeer-sinews from his mendy-bag and began to mend his spear.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come here, said Taffy. ‘Do you know where my Mummy lives?’ And the\\r\\nStranger-man said ‘Um!’ being, as you know, a Tewara.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Silly!’ said Taffy, and she stamped her foot, because she saw a shoal\\r\\nof very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy couldn’t use his\\r\\nspear.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t bother grown-ups,’ said Tegumai, so busy with his spear-mending\\r\\nthat he did not turn round.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I aren’t, said Taffy. ‘I only want him to do what I want him to do, and\\r\\nhe won’t understand.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then don’t bother me, said Tegumai, and he went on pulling and\\r\\nstraining at the deer-sinews with his mouth full of loose ends. The\\r\\nStranger-man--a genuine Tewara he was--sat down on the grass, and Taffy\\r\\nshowed him what her Daddy was doing. The Stranger-man thought, this is a\\r\\nvery wonderful child. She stamps her foot at me and she makes faces. She\\r\\nmust be the daughter of that noble Chief who is so great that he won’t\\r\\ntake any notice of me.’ So he smiled more politely than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now,’ said Taffy, ‘I want you to go to my Mummy, because your legs are\\r\\nlonger than mine, and you won’t fall into the beaver-swamp, and ask for\\r\\nDaddy’s other spear--the one with the black handle that hangs over our\\r\\nfireplace.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, ‘This is a very, very\\r\\nwonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me, but I don’t\\r\\nunderstand a word of what she says. But if I don’t do what she wants, I\\r\\ngreatly fear that that haughty Chief, Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers,\\r\\nwill be angry.’ He got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a\\r\\nbirch-tree and gave it to Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that\\r\\nhis heart was as white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but\\r\\nTaffy didn’t quite understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh!’ said she. ‘Now I see! You want my Mummy’s living-address? Of\\r\\ncourse I can’t write, but I can draw pictures if I’ve anything sharp to\\r\\nscratch with. Please lend me the shark’s tooth off your necklace.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) didn’t say anything, So Taffy\\r\\nput up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and seed and\\r\\nshark-tooth necklace round his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, ‘This is a very, very,\\r\\nvery wonderful child. The shark’s tooth on my necklace is a magic\\r\\nshark’s tooth, and I was always told that if anybody touched it without\\r\\nmy leave they would immediately swell up or burst, but this\\r\\nchild doesn’t swell up or burst, and that important Chief,\\r\\nMan-who-attends-strictly-to-his-business, who has not yet taken any\\r\\nnotice of me at all, doesn’t seem to be afraid that she will swell up or\\r\\nburst. I had better be more polite.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he gave Taffy the shark’s tooth, and she lay down flat on her tummy\\r\\nwith her legs in the air, like some people on the drawing-room floor\\r\\nwhen they want to draw pictures, and she said, ‘Now I’ll draw you some\\r\\nbeautiful pictures! You can look over my shoulder, but you mustn’t\\r\\njoggle. First I’ll draw Daddy fishing. It isn’t very like him; but Mummy\\r\\nwill know, because I’ve drawn his spear all broken. Well, now I’ll draw\\r\\nthe other spear that he wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if\\r\\nit was sticking in Daddy’s back, but that’s because the shark’s tooth\\r\\nslipped and this piece of bark isn’t big enough. That’s the spear I want\\r\\nyou to fetch; so I’ll draw a picture of me myself ‘splaining to you. My\\r\\nhair doesn’t stand up like I’ve drawn, but it’s easier to draw that way.\\r\\nNow I’ll draw you. I think you’re very nice really, but I can’t make you\\r\\npretty in the picture, so you mustn’t be ‘fended. Are you ‘fended?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) smiled. He thought, ‘There must\\r\\nbe a big battle going to be fought somewhere, and this extraordinary\\r\\nchild, who takes my magic shark’s tooth but who does not swell up or\\r\\nburst, is telling me to call all the great Chief’s tribe to help him. He\\r\\nis a great Chief, or he would have noticed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Look,’ said Taffy, drawing very hard and rather scratchily, ‘now I’ve\\r\\ndrawn you, and I’ve put the spear that Daddy wants into your hand, just\\r\\nto remind you that you’re to bring it. Now I’ll show you how to find my\\r\\nMummy’s living-address. You go along till you come to two trees (those\\r\\nare trees), and then you go over a hill (that’s a hill), and then you\\r\\ncome into a beaver-swamp all full of beavers. I haven’t put in all the\\r\\nbeavers, because I can’t draw beavers, but I’ve drawn their heads, and\\r\\nthat’s all you’ll see of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you don’t\\r\\nfall in! Then our Cave is just beyond the beaver-swamp. It isn’t as high\\r\\nas the hills really, but I can’t draw things very small. That’s my Mummy\\r\\noutside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest Mummy there\\r\\never was, but she won’t be ‘fended when she sees I’ve drawn her so\\r\\nplain. She’ll be pleased of me because I can draw. Now, in case you\\r\\nforget, I’ve drawn the spear that Daddy wants outside our Cave. It’s\\r\\ninside really, but you show the picture to my Mummy and she’ll give it\\r\\nyou. I’ve made her holding up her hands, because I know she’ll be so\\r\\npleased to see you. Isn’t it a beautiful picture? And do you quite\\r\\nunderstand, or shall I ‘splain again?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) looked at the picture and nodded\\r\\nvery hard. He said to himself,’ If I do not fetch this great Chief’s\\r\\ntribe to help him, he will be slain by his enemies who are coming up on\\r\\nall sides with spears. Now I see why the great Chief pretended not to\\r\\nnotice me! He feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and\\r\\nwould see him. Therefore he turned to me his back, and let the wise and\\r\\nwonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties.\\r\\nI will away and get help for him from his tribe.’ He did not even ask\\r\\nTaffy the road, but raced off into the bushes like the wind, with the\\r\\nbirch-bark in his hand, and Taffy sat down most pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for him!\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What have you been doing, Taffy?’ said Tegumai. He had mended his spear\\r\\nand was carefully waving it to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s a little berangement of my own, Daddy dear,’ said Taffy. ‘If you\\r\\nwon’t ask me questions, you’ll know all about it in a little time, and\\r\\nyou’ll be surprised. You don’t know how surprised you’ll be, Daddy!\\r\\nPromise you’ll be surprised.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very well,’ said Tegumai, and went on fishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stranger-man--did you know he was a Tewara?--hurried away with the\\r\\npicture and ran for some miles, till quite by accident he found Teshumai\\r\\nTewindrow at the door of her Cave, talking to some other Neolithic\\r\\nladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch. Taffy was very like\\r\\nTeshumai, especially about the upper part of the face and the eyes,\\r\\nso the Stranger-man--always a pure Tewara--smiled politely and handed\\r\\nTeshumai the birch-bark. He had run hard, so that he panted, and his\\r\\nlegs were scratched with brambles, but he still tried to be polite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything and flew\\r\\nat the Stranger-man. The other Neolithic ladies at once knocked him down\\r\\nand sat on him in a long line of six, while Teshumai pulled his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s as plain as the nose on this Stranger-man’s face,’ she said. ‘He\\r\\nhas stuck my Tegumai all full of spears, and frightened poor Taffy so\\r\\nthat her hair stands all on end; and not content with that, he brings\\r\\nme a horrid picture of how it was done. Look!’ She showed the picture to\\r\\nall the Neolithic ladies sitting patiently on the Stranger-man. ‘Here is\\r\\nmy Tegumai with his arm broken; here is a spear sticking into his back;\\r\\nhere is a man with a spear ready to throw; here is another man throwing\\r\\na spear from a Cave, and here are a whole pack of people’ (they were\\r\\nTaffy’s beavers really, but they did look rather like people) ‘coming up\\r\\nbehind Tegumai. Isn’t it shocking!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Most shocking!’ said the Neolithic ladies, and they filled the\\r\\nStranger-man’s hair with mud (at which he was surprised), and they beat\\r\\nupon the Reverberating Tribal Drums, and called together all the chiefs\\r\\nof the Tribe of Tegumai, with their Hetmans and Dolmans, all Neguses,\\r\\nWoons, and Akhoonds of the organisation, in addition to the Warlocks,\\r\\nAngekoks, Juju-men, Bonzes, and the rest, who decided that before they\\r\\nchopped the Stranger-man’s head off he should instantly lead them down\\r\\nto the river and show them where he had hidden poor Taffy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the Stranger-man (in spite of being a Tewara) was really\\r\\nannoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud; they had rolled\\r\\nhim up and down on knobby pebbles; they had sat upon him in a long\\r\\nline of six; they had thumped him and bumped him till he could hardly\\r\\nbreathe; and though he did not understand their language, he was almost\\r\\nsure that the names the Neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike.\\r\\nHowever, he said nothing till all the Tribe of Tegumai were assembled,\\r\\nand then he led them back to the bank of the Wagai river, and there they\\r\\nfound Taffy making daisy-chains, and Tegumai carefully spearing small\\r\\ncarp with his mended spear.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, you have been quick!’ said Taffy. ‘But why did you bring so many\\r\\npeople? Daddy dear, this is my surprise. Are you surprised, Daddy?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very,’ said Tegumai; ‘but it has ruined all my fishing for the day.\\r\\nWhy, the whole dear, kind, nice, clean, quiet Tribe is here, Taffy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the\\r\\nNeolithic ladies, tightly holding on to the Stranger-man, whose hair was\\r\\nfull of mud (although he was a Tewara). Behind them came the Head Chief,\\r\\nthe Vice-Chief, the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs (all armed to the upper\\r\\nteeth), the Hetmans and Heads of Hundreds, Platoffs with their Platoons,\\r\\nand Dolmans with their Detachments; Woons, Neguses, and Akhoonds ranking\\r\\nin the rear (still armed to the teeth). Behind them was the Tribe in\\r\\nhierarchical order, from owners of four caves (one for each season), a\\r\\nprivate reindeer-run, and two salmon-leaps, to feudal and prognathous\\r\\nVilleins, semi-entitled to half a bearskin of winter nights, seven yards\\r\\nfrom the fire, and adscript serfs, holding the reversion of a scraped\\r\\nmarrow-bone under heriot (Aren’t those beautiful words, Best Beloved?).\\r\\nThey were all there, prancing and shouting, and they frightened every\\r\\nfish for twenty miles, and Tegumai thanked them in a fluid Neolithic\\r\\noration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy very much\\r\\nindeed; but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took Tegumai by the\\r\\ntop-knot feathers and shook him severely.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Explain! Explain! Explain!’ cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Goodness’ sakes alive!’ said Tegumai. ‘Let go of my top-knot. Can’t\\r\\na man break his carp-spear without the whole countryside descending on\\r\\nhim? You’re a very interfering people.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t believe you’ve brought my Daddy’s black-handled spear after\\r\\nall,’ said Taffy. ‘And what are you doing to my nice Stranger-man?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes turned\\r\\nround and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Where are the bad people who speared you, my darling?’ said Teshumai\\r\\nTewindrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There weren’t any,’ said Tegumai. ‘My only visitor this morning was the\\r\\npoor fellow that you are trying to choke. Aren’t you well, or are you\\r\\nill, O Tribe of Tegumai?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He came with a horrible picture,’ said the Head Chief,--‘a picture that\\r\\nshowed you were full of spears.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Er-um-Pr’aps I’d better ‘splain that I gave him that picture,’ said\\r\\nTaffy, but she did not feel quite comfy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You!’ said the Tribe of Tegumai all together.\\r\\n‘Small-person-with-no-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked! You?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Taffy dear, I’m afraid we’re in for a little trouble,’ said her Daddy,\\r\\nand put his arm round her, so she didn’t care.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Explain! Explain! Explain!’ said the Head Chief of the Tribe of\\r\\nTegumai, and he hopped on one foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I wanted the Stranger-man to fetch Daddy’s spear, so I drawded it,’\\r\\nsaid Taffy. ‘There wasn’t lots of spears. There was only one spear. I\\r\\ndrawded it three times to make sure. I couldn’t help it looking as if it\\r\\nstuck into Daddy’s head--there wasn’t room on the birch-bark; and those\\r\\nthings that Mummy called bad people are my beavers. I drawded them to\\r\\nshow him the way through the swamp; and I drawded Mummy at the mouth of\\r\\nthe Cave looking pleased because he is a nice Stranger-man, and I think\\r\\nyou are just the stupidest people in the world,’ said Taffy. ‘He is a\\r\\nvery nice man. Why have you filled his hair with mud? Wash him!’\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody said anything at all for a longtime, till the Head Chief laughed;\\r\\nthen the Stranger-man (who was at least a Tewara) laughed; then Tegumai\\r\\nlaughed till he fell down flat on the bank; then all the Tribe laughed\\r\\nmore and worse and louder. The only people who did not laugh were\\r\\nTeshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies. They were very polite\\r\\nto all their husbands, and said ‘Idiot!’ ever so often.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and sang, ‘O\\r\\nSmall-person-with-out-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked, you’ve hit\\r\\nupon a great invention!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I didn’t intend to; I only wanted Daddy’s black-handled spear,’ said\\r\\nTaffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Never mind. It is a great invention, and some day men will call it\\r\\nwriting. At present it is only pictures, and, as we have seen to-day,\\r\\npictures are not always properly understood. But a time will come, O\\r\\nBabe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters--all twenty-six of ‘em,--and\\r\\nwhen we shall be able to read as well as to write, and then we shall\\r\\nalways say exactly what we mean without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic\\r\\nladies wash the mud out of the stranger’s hair.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I shall be glad of that,’ said Taffy, ‘because, after all, though\\r\\nyou’ve brought every single other spear in the Tribe of Tegumai, you’ve\\r\\nforgotten my Daddy’s black-handled spear.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Head Chief cried and said and sang, ‘Taffy dear, the next time\\r\\nyou write a picture-letter, you’d better send a man who can talk our\\r\\nlanguage with it, to explain what it means. I don’t mind it myself,\\r\\nbecause I am a Head Chief, but it’s very bad for the rest of the Tribe\\r\\nof Tegumai, and, as you can see, it surprises the stranger.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they adopted the Stranger-man (a genuine Tewara of Tewar) into the\\r\\nTribe of Tegumai, because he was a gentleman and did not make a fuss\\r\\nabout the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into his hair. But\\r\\nfrom that day to this (and I suppose it is all Taffy’s fault), very few\\r\\nlittle girls have ever liked learning to read or write. Most of them\\r\\nprefer to draw pictures and play about with their Daddies--just like\\r\\nTaffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     THERE runs a road by Merrow Down--\\r\\n       A grassy track to-day it is\\r\\n     An hour out of Guildford town,\\r\\n       Above the river Wey it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,\\r\\n       The ancient Britons dressed and rode\\r\\n     To watch the dark Phoenicians bring\\r\\n       Their goods along the Western Road.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And here, or hereabouts, they met\\r\\n       To hold their racial talks and such--\\r\\n     To barter beads for Whitby jet,\\r\\n       And tin for gay shell torques and such.\\r\\n\\r\\n     But long and long before that time\\r\\n       (When bison used to roam on it)\\r\\n     Did Taffy and her Daddy climb\\r\\n       That down, and had their home on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Then beavers built in Broadstone brook\\r\\n       And made a swamp where Bramley stands:\\r\\n     And bears from Shere would come and look\\r\\n       For Taffimai where Shamley stands.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,\\r\\n       Was more than six times bigger then;\\r\\n     And all the Tribe of Tegumai\\r\\n       They cut a noble figure then!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE week after Taffimai Metallumai (we will still call her Taffy,\\r\\nBest Beloved) made that little mistake about her Daddy’s spear and the\\r\\nStranger-man and the picture-letter and all, she went carp-fishing again\\r\\nwith her Daddy. Her Mummy wanted her to stay at home and help hang up\\r\\nhides to dry on the big drying-poles outside their Neolithic Cave,\\r\\nbut Taffy slipped away down to her Daddy quite early, and they fished.\\r\\nPresently she began to giggle, and her Daddy said, ‘Don’t be silly,\\r\\nchild.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But wasn’t it inciting!’ said Taffy. ‘Don’t you remember how the Head\\r\\nChief puffed out his cheeks, and how funny the nice Stranger-man looked\\r\\nwith the mud in his hair?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well do I,’ said Tegumai. ‘I had to pay two deerskins--soft ones with\\r\\nfringes--to the Stranger-man for the things we did to him.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We didn’t do anything,’ said Taffy. ‘It was Mummy and the other\\r\\nNeolithic ladies--and the mud.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We won’t talk about that,’ said her Daddy, ‘Let’s have lunch.’\\r\\n\\r\\nTaffy took a marrow-bone and sat mousy-quiet for ten whole minutes,\\r\\nwhile her Daddy scratched on pieces of birch-bark with a shark’s tooth.\\r\\nThen she said, ‘Daddy, I’ve thinked of a secret surprise. You make a\\r\\nnoise--any sort of noise.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ said Tegumai. ‘Will that do to begin with?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Taffy. ‘You look just like a carp-fish with its mouth open.\\r\\nSay it again, please.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah! ah! ah!’ said her Daddy. ‘Don’t be rude, my daughter.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’m not meaning rude, really and truly,’ said Taffy. ‘It’s part of my\\r\\nsecret-surprise-think. Do say ah, Daddy, and keep your mouth open at\\r\\nthe end, and lend me that tooth. I’m going to draw a carp-fish’s mouth\\r\\nwide-open.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What for?’ said her Daddy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t you see?’ said Taffy, scratching away on the bark. ‘That will be\\r\\nour little secret s’prise. When I draw a carp-fish with his mouth open\\r\\nin the smoke at the back of our Cave--if Mummy doesn’t mind--it will\\r\\nremind you of that ah-noise. Then we can play that it was me jumped\\r\\nout of the dark and s’prised you with that noise--same as I did in the\\r\\nbeaver-swamp last winter.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Really?’ said her Daddy, in the voice that grown-ups use when they are\\r\\ntruly attending. ‘Go on, Taffy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh bother!’ she said. ‘I can’t draw all of a carp-fish, but I can draw\\r\\nsomething that means a carp-fish’s mouth. Don’t you know how they stand\\r\\non their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here’s a pretence carp-fish (we\\r\\ncan play that the rest of him is drawn). Here’s just his mouth, and that\\r\\nmeans ah.’ And she drew this. (1.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s not bad,’ said Tegumai, and scratched on his own piece of bark\\r\\nfor himself; but you’ve forgotten the feeler that hangs across his\\r\\nmouth.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But I can’t draw, Daddy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You needn’t draw anything of him except just the opening of his mouth\\r\\nand the feeler across. Then we’ll know he’s a carp-fish, ‘cause the\\r\\nperches and trouts haven’t got feelers. Look here, Taffy.’ And he drew\\r\\nthis. (2.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now I’ll copy it.’ said Taffy. ‘Will you understand this when you see\\r\\nit?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Perfectly,’ said her Daddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she drew this. (3.) ‘And I’ll be quite as s’prised when I see it\\r\\nanywhere, as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and said ‘“Ah!”’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now, make another noise,’ said Taffy, very proud.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yah!’ said her Daddy, very loud.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘H’m,’ said Taffy. ‘That’s a mixy noise. The end part is\\r\\nah-carp-fish-mouth; but what can we do about the front part? Yer-yer-yer\\r\\nand ah! Ya!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s very like the carp-fish-mouth noise. Let’s draw another bit of the\\r\\ncarp-fish and join ‘em,’ said her Daddy. He was quite incited too.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No. If they’re joined, I’ll forget. Draw it separate. Draw his tail.\\r\\nIf he’s standing on his head the tail will come first. ‘Sides, I think I\\r\\ncan draw tails easiest,’ said Taffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A good notion,’ said Tegumai. ‘Here’s a carp-fish tail for the\\r\\nyer-noise.’ And he drew this. (4.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll try now,’ said Taffy. ‘’Member I can’t draw like you, Daddy. Will\\r\\nit do if I just draw the split part of the tail, and the sticky-down\\r\\nline for where it joins?’ And she drew this. (5.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHer Daddy nodded, and his eyes were shiny bright with ‘citement.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s beautiful,’ she said. ‘Now make another noise, Daddy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh!’ said her Daddy, very loud.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s quite easy,’ said Taffy. ‘You make your mouth all around like an\\r\\negg or a stone. So an egg or a stone will do for that.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You can’t always find eggs or stones. We’ll have to scratch a round\\r\\nsomething like one.’ And he drew this. (6.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My gracious!’ said Taffy, ‘what a lot of noise-pictures we’ve\\r\\nmade,--carp-mouth, carp-tail, and egg! Now, make another noise, Daddy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ssh!’ said her Daddy, and frowned to himself, but Taffy was too incited\\r\\nto notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s quite easy,’ she said, scratching on the bark.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Eh, what?’ said her Daddy. ‘I meant I was thinking, and didn’t want to\\r\\nbe disturbed.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s a noise just the same. It’s the noise a snake makes, Daddy,\\r\\nwhen it is thinking and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Let’s make the\\r\\nssh-noise a snake. Will this do?’ And she drew this. (7.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There,’ she said. ‘That’s another s’prise-secret. When you draw a\\r\\nhissy-snake by the door of your little back-cave where you mend\\r\\nthe spears, I’ll know you’re thinking hard; and I’ll come in most\\r\\nmousy-quiet. And if you draw it on a tree by the river when you are\\r\\nfishing, I’ll know you want me to walk most most mousy-quiet, so as not\\r\\nto shake the banks.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Perfectly true,’ said Tegumai. And there’s more in this game than you\\r\\nthink. Taffy, dear, I’ve a notion that your Daddy’s daughter has hit\\r\\nupon the finest thing that there ever was since the Tribe of Tegumai\\r\\ntook to using shark’s teeth instead of flints for their spear-heads. I\\r\\nbelieve we’ve found out the big secret of the world.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why?’ said Taffy, and her eyes shone too with incitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll show,’ said her Daddy. ‘What’s water in the Tegumai language?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ya, of course, and it means river too--like Wagai-ya--the Wagai river.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What is bad water that gives you fever if you drink it--black\\r\\nwater--swamp-water?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yo, of course.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now look,’ said her Daddy. ‘S’pose you saw this scratched by the side\\r\\nof a pool in the beaver-swamp?’ And he drew this. (8.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Carp-tail and round egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,’ said Taffy.\\r\\n‘’Course I wouldn’t drink that water because I’d know you said it was\\r\\nbad.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But I needn’t be near the water at all. I might be miles away, hunting,\\r\\nand still--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And still it would be just the same as if you stood there and said,\\r\\n“G’way, Taffy, or you’ll get fever.” All that in a carp-fish-tail and\\r\\na round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy, quick!’ and Taffy danced all\\r\\nround him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not yet,’ said Tegumai; ‘not till we’ve gone a little further. Let’s\\r\\nsee. Yo is bad water, but So is food cooked on the fire, isn’t it?’ And\\r\\nhe drew this. (9.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes. Snake and egg,’ said Taffy ‘So that means dinner’s ready. If you\\r\\nsaw that scratched on a tree you’d know it was time to come to the Cave.\\r\\nSo’d I.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My Winkie!’ said Tegumai. ‘That’s true too. But wait a minute. I see\\r\\na difficulty. SO means “come and have dinner,” but sho means the\\r\\ndrying-poles where we hang our hides.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Horrid old drying-poles!’ said Taffy. ‘I hate helping to hang heavy,\\r\\nhot, hairy hides on them. If you drew the snake and egg, and I thought\\r\\nit meant dinner, and I came in from the wood and found that it meant I\\r\\nwas to help Mummy hang the two hides on the drying-poles, what would I\\r\\ndo?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You’d be cross. So’d Mummy. We must make a new picture for sho. We must\\r\\ndraw a spotty snake that hisses sh-sh, and we’ll play that the plain\\r\\nsnake only hisses ssss.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I couldn’t be sure how to put in the spots,’ said Taffy. ‘And p’raps\\r\\nif you were in a hurry you might leave them out, and I’d think it was\\r\\nso when it was sho, and then Mummy would catch me just the same. No! I\\r\\nthink we’d better draw a picture of the horrid high drying-poles their\\r\\nvery selves, and make quite sure. I’ll put them in just after the\\r\\nhissy-snake. Look!’ And she drew this. (10.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘P’raps that’s safest. It’s very like our drying-poles, anyhow,’\\r\\nsaid her Daddy, laughing. ‘Now I’ll make a new noise with a snake and\\r\\ndrying-pole sound in it. I’ll say shi. That’s Tegumai for spear, Taffy.’\\r\\nAnd he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t make fun of me,’ said Taffy, as she thought of her picture-letter\\r\\nand the mud in the Stranger-man’s hair. ‘You draw it, Daddy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We won’t have beavers or hills this time, eh?’ said her Daddy, ‘I’ll\\r\\njust draw a straight line for my spear.’ and he drew this. (11.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Even Mummy couldn’t mistake that for me being killed.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Please don’t, Daddy. It makes me uncomfy. Do some more noises. We’re\\r\\ngetting on beautifully.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Er-hm!’ said Tegumai, looking up. ‘We’ll say shu. That means sky.’\\r\\n\\r\\nTaffy drew the snake and the drying-pole. Then she stopped. ‘We must\\r\\nmake a new picture for that end sound, mustn’t we?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Shu-shu-u-u-u!’ said her Daddy. ‘Why, it’s just like the\\r\\nround-egg-sound made thin.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then s’pose we draw a thin round egg, and pretend it’s a frog that\\r\\nhasn’t eaten anything for years.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘N-no,’ said her Daddy. ‘If we drew that in a hurry we might mistake it\\r\\nfor the round egg itself. Shu-shu-shu! ‘I tell you what we’ll do. We’ll\\r\\nopen a little hole at the end of the round egg to show how the O-noise\\r\\nruns out all thin, ooo-oo-oo. Like this.’ And he drew this. (12.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, that’s lovely! Much better than a thin frog. Go on,’ said Taffy,\\r\\nusing her shark’s tooth. Her Daddy went on drawing, and his hand shook\\r\\nwith incitement. He went on till he had drawn this. (13.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t look up, Taffy,’ he said. ‘Try if you can make out what that\\r\\nmeans in the Tegumai language. If you can, we’ve found the Secret.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Snake--pole--broken--egg--carp--tail and carp-mouth,’ said Taffy.\\r\\n‘Shu-ya. Sky-water (rain).’ Just then a drop fell on her hand, for the\\r\\nday had clouded over. ‘Why, Daddy, it’s raining. Was that what you meant\\r\\nto tell me?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Of course,’ said her Daddy. ‘And I told it you without saying a word,\\r\\ndidn’t I?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, I think I would have known it in a minute, but that raindrop made\\r\\nme quite sure. I’ll always remember now. Shu-ya means rain, or “it is\\r\\ngoing to rain.” Why, Daddy!’ She got up and danced round him. ‘S’pose\\r\\nyou went out before I was awake, and drawed shu-ya in the smoke on the\\r\\nwall, I’d know it was going to rain and I’d take my beaver-skin hood.\\r\\nWouldn’t Mummy be surprised?’\\r\\n\\r\\nTegumai got up and danced. (Daddies didn’t mind doing those things in\\r\\nthose days.) ‘More than that! More than that!’ he said. ‘S’pose I wanted\\r\\nto tell you it wasn’t going to rain much and you must come down to the\\r\\nriver, what would we draw? Say the words in Tegumai-talk first.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Shu-ya-las, ya maru. (Sky-water ending. River come to.) what a lot of\\r\\nnew sounds! I don’t see how we can draw them.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But I do--but I do!’ said Tegumai. ‘Just attend a minute, Taffy, and\\r\\nwe won’t do any more to-day. We’ve got shu-ya all right, haven’t we? But\\r\\nthis las is a teaser. La-la-la’ and he waved his shark-tooth.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There’s the hissy-snake at the end and the carp-mouth before the\\r\\nsnake--as-as-as. We only want la-la,’ said Taffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I know it, but we have to make la-la. And we’re the first people in all\\r\\nthe world who’ve ever tried to do it, Taffimai!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said Taffy, yawning, for she was rather tired. ‘Las means\\r\\nbreaking or finishing as well as ending, doesn’t it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘So it does,’ said Tegumai. ‘To-las means that there’s no water in the\\r\\ntank for Mummy to cook with--just when I’m going hunting, too.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And shi-las means that your spear is broken. If I’d only thought of\\r\\nthat instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the Stranger!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘La! La! La!’ said Tegumai, waiving his stick and frowning. ‘Oh bother!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I could have drawn shi quite easily,’ Taffy went on. ‘Then I’d have\\r\\ndrawn your spear all broken--this way!’ And she drew. (14.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The very thing,’ said Tegumai. ‘That’s la all over. It isn’t like any\\r\\nof the other marks either.’ And he drew this. (15.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now for ya. Oh, we’ve done that before. Now for maru. Mum-mum-mum. Mum\\r\\nshuts one’s mouth up, doesn’t it? We’ll draw a shut mouth like this.’\\r\\nAnd he drew. (16.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then the carp-mouth open. That makes Ma-ma-ma! But what about this\\r\\nrrrrr-thing, Taffy?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It sounds all rough and edgy, like your shark-tooth saw when you’re\\r\\ncutting out a plank for the canoe,’ said Taffy.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You mean all sharp at the edges, like this?’ said Tegumai. And he drew.\\r\\n(17.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘’Xactly,’ said Taffy. ‘But we don’t want all those teeth: only put\\r\\ntwo.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll only put in one,’ said Tegumai. ‘If this game of ours is going\\r\\nto be what I think it will, the easier we make our sound-pictures the\\r\\nbetter for everybody.’ And he drew. (18.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now, we’ve got it,’ said Tegumai, standing on one leg. ‘I’ll draw ‘em\\r\\nall in a string like fish.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Hadn’t we better put a little bit of stick or something between each\\r\\nword, so’s they won’t rub up against each other and jostle, same as if\\r\\nthey were carps?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, I’ll leave a space for that,’ said her Daddy. And very incitedly he\\r\\ndrew them all without stopping, on a big new bit of birch-bark. (19.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Shu-ya-las ya-maru,’ said Taffy, reading it out sound by sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s enough for to-day,’ said Tegumai. ‘Besides, you’re getting\\r\\ntired, Taffy. Never mind, dear. We’ll finish it all to-morrow, and then\\r\\nwe’ll be remembered for years and years after the biggest trees you can\\r\\nsee are all chopped up for firewood.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went home, and all that evening Tegumai sat on one side of the\\r\\nfire and Taffy on the other, drawing ya’s and yo’s and shu’s and shi’s\\r\\nin the smoke on the wall and giggling together till her Mummy said,\\r\\n‘Really, Tegumai, you’re worse than my Taffy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Please don’t mind,’ said Taffy. ‘It’s only our secret-s’prise, Mummy\\r\\ndear, and we’ll tell you all about it the very minute it’s done; but\\r\\nplease don’t ask me what it is now, or else I’ll have to tell.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo her Mummy most carefully didn’t; and bright and early next morning\\r\\nTegumai went down to the river to think about new sound pictures,\\r\\nand when Taffy got up she saw Ya-las (water is ending or running out)\\r\\nchalked on the side of the big stone water-tank, outside the Cave.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Um,’ said Taffy. ‘These picture-sounds are rather a bother! Daddy’s\\r\\njust as good as come here himself and told me to get more water for\\r\\nMummy to cook with.’ She went to the spring at the back of the house and\\r\\nfilled the tank from a bark bucket, and then she ran down to the river\\r\\nand pulled her Daddy’s left ear--the one that belonged to her to pull\\r\\nwhen she was good.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now come along and we’ll draw all the left-over sound-pictures,’ said\\r\\nher Daddy, and they had a most inciting day of it, and a beautiful lunch\\r\\nin the middle, and two games of romps. When they came to T, Taffy said\\r\\nthat as her name, and her Daddy’s, and her Mummy’s all began with that\\r\\nsound, they should draw a sort of family group of themselves holding\\r\\nhands. That was all very well to draw once or twice; but when it came to\\r\\ndrawing it six or seven times, Taffy and Tegumai drew it scratchier and\\r\\nscratchier, till at last the T-sound was only a thin long Tegumai with\\r\\nhis arms out to hold Taffy and Teshumai. You can see from these three\\r\\npictures partly how it happened. (20, 21, 22.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin with,\\r\\nespecially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and over again on\\r\\nbirch-bark, they became plainer and easier, till at last even Tegumai\\r\\nsaid he could find no fault with them. They turned the hissy-snake the\\r\\nother way round for the Z-sound, to show it was hissing backwards in a\\r\\nsoft and gentle way (23); and they just made a twiddle for E, because\\r\\nit came into the pictures so often (24); and they drew pictures of the\\r\\nsacred Beaver of the Tegumais for the B-sound (25, 26, 27, 28); and\\r\\nbecause it was a nasty, nosy noise, they just drew noses for the\\r\\nN-sound, till they were tired (29); and they drew a picture of the big\\r\\nlake-pike’s mouth for the greedy Ga-sound (30); and they drew the pike’s\\r\\nmouth again with a spear behind it for the scratchy, hurty Ka-sound\\r\\n(31); and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river\\r\\nfor the nice windy-windy Wa-sound (32, 33); and so on and so forth and\\r\\nso following till they had done and drawn all the sound-pictures that\\r\\nthey wanted, and there was the Alphabet, all complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and after\\r\\nHieroglyphics and Demotics, and Nilotics, and Cryptics, and Cufics, and\\r\\nRunics, and Dorics, and Ionics, and all sorts of other ricks and\\r\\ntricks (because the Woons, and the Neguses, and the Akhoonds, and the\\r\\nRepositories of Tradition would never leave a good thing alone when they\\r\\nsaw it), the fine old easy, understandable Alphabet--A, B, C, D, E,\\r\\nand the rest of ‘em--got back into its proper shape again for all Best\\r\\nBeloveds to learn when they are old enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I remember Tegumai Bopsulai, and Taffimai Metallumai and Teshumai\\r\\nTewindrow, her dear Mummy, and all the days gone by. And it was so--just\\r\\nso--a little time ago--on the banks of the big Wagai!\\r\\n\\r\\n     OF all the Tribe of Tegumai\\r\\n       Who cut that figure, none remain,--\\r\\n     On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry\\r\\n       The silence and the sun remain.\\r\\n\\r\\n     But as the faithful years return\\r\\n       And hearts unwounded sing again,\\r\\n     Comes Taffy dancing through the fern\\r\\n       To lead the Surrey spring again.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,\\r\\n       And golden elf-locks fly above;\\r\\n     Her eyes are bright as diamonds\\r\\n       And bluer than the skies above.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,\\r\\n       Unfearing, free and fair she flits,\\r\\n     And lights her little damp-wood smoke\\r\\n       To show her Daddy where she flits.\\r\\n\\r\\n     For far--oh, very far behind,\\r\\n       So far she cannot call to him,\\r\\n     Comes Tegumai alone to find\\r\\n       The daughter that was all to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CRAB THAT PLAYED WITH THE SEA\\r\\n\\r\\nBEFORE the High and Far-Off Times, O my Best Beloved, came the Time of\\r\\nthe Very Beginnings; and that was in the days when the Eldest Magician\\r\\nwas getting Things ready. First he got the Earth ready; then he got the\\r\\nSea ready; and then he told all the Animals that they could come out and\\r\\nplay. And the Animals said, ‘O Eldest Magician, what shall we play\\r\\nat?’ and he said, ‘I will show you. He took the\\r\\nElephant--All-the-Elephant-there-was--and said, ‘Play at being\\r\\nan Elephant,’ and All-the-Elephant-there-was played. He took the\\r\\nBeaver--All-the-Beaver-there-was and said, ‘Play at being a Beaver,’\\r\\nand All-the Beaver-there-was played. He took the Cow--All-the\\r\\nCow-there-was--and said, ‘Play at being a Cow,’ and\\r\\nAll-the-Cow-there-was played. He took the Turtle--All-the-Turtle\\r\\nthere-was and said, ‘Play at being a Turtle,’ and\\r\\nAll-the-Turtle-there-was played. One by one he took all the beasts and\\r\\nbirds and fishes and told them what to play at.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut towards evening, when people and things grow restless and tired,\\r\\nthere came up the Man (With his own little girl-daughter?)--Yes, with\\r\\nhis own best beloved little girl-daughter sitting upon his shoulder, and\\r\\nhe said, ‘What is this play, Eldest Magician?’ And the Eldest Magician\\r\\nsaid, ‘Ho, Son of Adam, this is the play of the Very Beginning; but you\\r\\nare too wise for this play.’ And the Man saluted and said, ‘Yes, I am\\r\\ntoo wise for this play; but see that you make all the Animals obedient\\r\\nto me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while the two were talking together, Pau Amma the Crab, who was\\r\\nnext in the game, scuttled off sideways and stepped into the sea, saying\\r\\nto himself, ‘I will play my play alone in the deep waters, and I will\\r\\nnever be obedient to this son of Adam.’ Nobody saw him go away except\\r\\nthe little girl-daughter where she leaned on the Man’s shoulder. And the\\r\\nplay went on till there were no more Animals left without orders; and\\r\\nthe Eldest Magician wiped the fine dust off his hands and walked about\\r\\nthe world to see how the Animals were playing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went North, Best Beloved, and he found All-the-Elephant-there-was\\r\\ndigging with his tusks and stamping with his feet in the nice new clean\\r\\nearth that had been made ready for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Kun?’ said All-the-Elephant-there-was, meaning, ‘Is this right?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah kun,’ said the Eldest Magician, meaning, ‘That is quite\\r\\nright’; and he breathed upon the great rocks and lumps of earth that\\r\\nAll-the-Elephant-there-was had thrown up, and they became the great\\r\\nHimalayan Mountains, and you can look them out on the map.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went East, and he found All-the-Cow there-was feeding in the field\\r\\nthat had been made ready for her, and she licked her tongue round a\\r\\nwhole forest at a time, and swallowed it and sat down to chew her cud.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Kun?’ said All-the-Cow-there-was.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah kun,’ said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the bare\\r\\npatch where she had eaten, and upon the place where she had sat down,\\r\\nand one became the great Indian Desert, and the other became the Desert\\r\\nof Sahara, and you can look them out on the map.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went West, and he found All-the-Beaver-there-was making a beaver-dam\\r\\nacross the mouths of broad rivers that had been got ready for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Kun?’ said All-the-Beaver-there-was.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah kun,’ said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the fallen\\r\\ntrees and the still water, and they became the Everglades in Florida,\\r\\nand you may look them out on the map.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went South and found All-the-Turtle-there-was scratching with\\r\\nhis flippers in the sand that had been got ready for him, and the sand\\r\\nand the rocks whirled through the air and fell far off into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Kun?’ said All-the-Turtle-there-was.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah kun,’ said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the sand and\\r\\nthe rocks, where they had fallen in the sea, and they became the most\\r\\nbeautiful islands of Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, and the rest of the\\r\\nMalay Archipelago, and you can look them out on the map!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by the Eldest Magician met the Man on the banks of the Perak\\r\\nriver, and said, ‘Ho! Son of Adam, are all the Animals obedient to you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said the Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Is all the Earth obedient to you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said the Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Is all the Sea obedient to you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Man. ‘Once a day and once a night the Sea runs up the\\r\\nPerak river and drives the sweet-water back into the forest, so that my\\r\\nhouse is made wet; once a day and once a night it runs down the river\\r\\nand draws all the water after it, so that there is nothing left but mud,\\r\\nand my canoe is upset. Is that the play you told it to play?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘That is a new and a bad play.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Look!’ said the Man, and as he spoke the great Sea came up the mouth of\\r\\nthe Perak river, driving the river backwards till it overflowed all the\\r\\ndark forests for miles and miles, and flooded the Man’s house.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘This is wrong. Launch your canoe and we will find out who is playing\\r\\nwith the Sea,’ said the Eldest Magician. They stepped into the canoe;\\r\\nthe little girl-daughter came with them; and the Man took his kris--a\\r\\ncurving, wavy dagger with a blade like a flame,--and they pushed out on\\r\\nthe Perak river. Then the sea began to run back and back, and the canoe\\r\\nwas sucked out of the mouth of the Perak river, past Selangor, past\\r\\nMalacca, past Singapore, out and out to the Island of Bingtang, as\\r\\nthough it had been pulled by a string.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Eldest Magician stood up and shouted, ‘Ho! beasts, birds, and\\r\\nfishes, that I took between my hands at the Very Beginning and taught\\r\\nthe play that you should play, which one of you is playing with the\\r\\nSea?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all the beasts, birds, and fishes said together, ‘Eldest Magician,\\r\\nwe play the plays that you taught us to play--we and our children’s\\r\\nchildren. But not one of us plays with the Sea.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Moon rose big and full over the water, and the Eldest Magician\\r\\nsaid to the hunchbacked old man who sits in the Moon spinning a\\r\\nfishing-line with which he hopes one day to catch the world, ‘Ho! Fisher\\r\\nof the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Fisherman, ‘I am spinning a line with which I shall some\\r\\nday catch the world; but I do not play with the Sea.’ And he went on\\r\\nspinning his line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there is also a Rat up in the Moon who always bites the old\\r\\nFisherman’s line as fast as it is made, and the Eldest Magician said to\\r\\nhim, ‘Ho! Rat of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Rat said, ‘I am too busy biting through the line that this\\r\\nold Fisherman is spinning. I do not play with the Sea.’ And he went on\\r\\nbiting the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the little girl-daughter put up her little soft brown arms with the\\r\\nbeautiful white shell bracelets and said, ‘O Eldest Magician! when my\\r\\nfather here talked to you at the Very Beginning, and I leaned upon his\\r\\nshoulder while the beasts were being taught their plays, one beast went\\r\\naway naughtily into the Sea before you had taught him his play.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician said, ‘How wise are little children who see and\\r\\nare silent! What was the beast like?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little girl-daughter said, ‘He was round and he was flat; and\\r\\nhis eyes grew upon stalks; and he walked sideways like this; and he was\\r\\ncovered with strong armour upon his back.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician said, ‘How wise are little children who speak\\r\\ntruth! Now I know where Pau Amma went. Give me the paddle!’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he took the paddle; but there was no need to paddle, for the water\\r\\nflowed steadily past all the islands till they came to the place called\\r\\nPusat Tasek--the Heart of the Sea--where the great hollow is that leads\\r\\ndown to the heart of the world, and in that hollow grows the Wonderful\\r\\nTree, Pauh Janggi, that bears the magic twin nuts. Then the Eldest\\r\\nMagician slid his arm up to the shoulder through the deep warm water,\\r\\nand under the roots of the Wonderful Tree he touched the broad back of\\r\\nPau Amma the Crab. And Pau Amma settled down at the touch, and all the\\r\\nSea rose up as water rises in a basin when you put your hand into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘Now I know who has been playing with\\r\\nthe Sea;’ and he called out, ‘What are you doing, Pau Amma?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pau Amma, deep down below, answered, ‘Once a day and once a night I\\r\\ngo out to look for my food. Once a day and once a night I return. Leave\\r\\nme alone.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Eldest Magician said, ‘Listen, Pau Amma. When you go out from\\r\\nyour cave the waters of the Sea pour down into Pusat Tasek, and all the\\r\\nbeaches of all the islands are left bare, and the little fish die, and\\r\\nRaja Moyang Kaban, the King of the Elephants, his legs are made muddy.\\r\\nWhen you come back and sit in Pusat Tasek, the waters of the Sea rise,\\r\\nand half the little islands are drowned, and the Man’s house is flooded,\\r\\nand Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, his mouth is filled with\\r\\nthe salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Pau Amma, deep down below, laughed and said, ‘I did not know I\\r\\nwas so important. Henceforward I will go out seven times a day, and the\\r\\nwaters shall never be still.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician said, ‘I cannot make you play the play you were\\r\\nmeant to play, Pau Amma, because you escaped me at the Very Beginning;\\r\\nbut if you are not afraid, come up and we will talk about it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I am not afraid,’ said Pau Amma, and he rose to the top of the sea in\\r\\nthe moonlight. There was nobody in the world so big as Pau Amma--for he\\r\\nwas the King Crab of all Crabs. Not a common Crab, but a King Crab. One\\r\\nside of his great shell touched the beach at Sarawak; the other\\r\\ntouched the beach at Pahang; and he was taller than the smoke of three\\r\\nvolcanoes! As he rose up through the branches of the Wonderful Tree he\\r\\ntore off one of the great twin fruits--the magic double kernelled nuts\\r\\nthat make people young,--and the little girl-daughter saw it bobbing\\r\\nalongside the canoe, and pulled it in and began to pick out the soft\\r\\neyes of it with her little golden scissors.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now,’ said the Magician, ‘make a Magic, Pau Amma, to show that you are\\r\\nreally important.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPau Amma rolled his eyes and waved his legs, but he could only stir up\\r\\nthe Sea, because, though he was a King Crab, he was nothing more than a\\r\\nCrab, and the Eldest Magician laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are not so important after all, Pau Amma,’ he said. ‘Now, let\\r\\nme try,’ and he made a Magic with his left hand--with just the little\\r\\nfinger of his left hand--and--lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma’s\\r\\nhard, blue-green-black shell fell off him as a husk falls off a\\r\\ncocoa-nut, and Pau Amma was left all soft--soft as the little crabs that\\r\\nyou sometimes find on the beach, Best Beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Indeed, you are very important,’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘Shall I ask\\r\\nthe Man here to cut you with kris? Shall I send for Raja Moyang Kaban,\\r\\nthe King of the Elephants, to pierce you with his tusks, or shall I call\\r\\nRaja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, to bite you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pau Amma said, ‘I am ashamed! Give me back my hard shell and let me\\r\\ngo back to Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out once a day and once a\\r\\nnight to get my food.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician said, ‘No, Pau Amma, I will not give you back\\r\\nyour shell, for you will grow bigger and prouder and stronger, and\\r\\nperhaps you will forget your promise, and you will play with the Sea\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Pau Amma said, ‘What shall I do? I am so big that I can only hide\\r\\nin Pusat Tasek, and if I go anywhere else, all soft as I am now, the\\r\\nsharks and the dogfish will eat me. And if I go to Pusat Tasek, all soft\\r\\nas I am now, though I may be safe, I can never stir out to get my food,\\r\\nand so I shall die.’ Then he waved his legs and lamented.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Listen, Pau Amma,’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘I cannot make you play\\r\\nthe play you were meant to play, because you escaped me at the Very\\r\\nBeginning; but if you choose, I can make every stone and every hole and\\r\\nevery bunch of weed in all the seas a safe Pusat Tasek for you and your\\r\\nchildren for always.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Pau Amma said, ‘That is good, but I do not choose yet. Look! there\\r\\nis that Man who talked to you at the Very Beginning. If he had not taken\\r\\nup your attention I should not have grown tired of waiting and run away,\\r\\nand all this would never have happened. What will he do for me?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Man said, ‘If you choose, I will make a Magic, so that both\\r\\nthe deep water and the dry ground will be a home for you and your\\r\\nchildren--so that you shall be able to hide both on the land and in the\\r\\nsea.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pau Amma said, ‘I do not choose yet. Look! there is that girl who\\r\\nsaw me running away at the Very Beginning. If she had spoken then, the\\r\\nEldest Magician would have called me back, and all this would never have\\r\\nhappened. What will she do for me?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little girl-daughter said, ‘This is a good nut that I am eating.\\r\\nIf you choose, I will make a Magic and I will give you this pair of\\r\\nscissors, very sharp and strong, so that you and your children can eat\\r\\ncocoa-nuts like this all day long when you come up from the Sea to the\\r\\nland; or you can dig a Pusat Tasek for yourself with the scissors that\\r\\nbelong to you when there is no stone or hole near by; and when the earth\\r\\nis too hard, by the help of these same scissors you can run up a tree.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pau Amma said, ‘I do not choose yet, for, all soft as I am, these\\r\\ngifts would not help me. Give me back my shell, O Eldest Magician, and\\r\\nthen I will play your play.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician said, ‘I will give it back, Pau Amma, for eleven\\r\\nmonths of the year; but on the twelfth month of every year it shall grow\\r\\nsoft again, to remind you and all your children that I can make magics,\\r\\nand to keep you humble, Pau Amma; for I see that if you can run both\\r\\nunder the water and on land, you will grow too bold; and if you can\\r\\nclimb trees and crack nuts and dig holes with your scissors, you will\\r\\ngrow too greedy, Pau Amma.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Pau Amma thought a little and said, ‘I have made my choice. I will\\r\\ntake all the gifts.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Eldest Magician made a Magic with the right hand, with all five\\r\\nfingers of his right hand, and lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma\\r\\ngrew smaller and smaller and smaller, till at last there was only a\\r\\nlittle green crab swimming in the water alongside the canoe, crying in a\\r\\nvery small voice, ‘Give me the scissors!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the girl-daughter picked him up on the palm of her little brown\\r\\nhand, and sat him in the bottom of the canoe and gave him her scissors,\\r\\nand he waved them in his little arms, and opened them and shut them and\\r\\nsnapped them, and said, ‘I can eat nuts. I can crack shells. I can dig\\r\\nholes. I can climb trees. I can breathe in the dry air, and I can find\\r\\na safe Pusat Tasek under every stone. I did not know I was so important.\\r\\nKun?’ (Is this right?)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah-kun,’ said the Eldest Magician, and he laughed and gave him his\\r\\nblessing; and little Pau Amma scuttled over the side of the canoe into\\r\\nthe water; and he was so tiny that he could have hidden under the shadow\\r\\nof a dry leaf on land or of a dead shell at the bottom of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Was that well done?’ said the Eldest Magician.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said the Man. ‘But now we must go back to Perak, and that is\\r\\na weary way to paddle. If we had waited till Pau Amma had gone out of\\r\\nPusat Tasek and come home, the water would have carried us there by\\r\\nitself.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are lazy,’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘So your children shall be\\r\\nlazy. They shall be the laziest people in the world. They shall be\\r\\ncalled the Malazy--the lazy people;’ and he held up his finger to the\\r\\nMoon and said, ‘O Fisherman, here is the Man too lazy to row home. Pull\\r\\nhis canoe home with your line, Fisherman.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Man. ‘If I am to be lazy all my days, let the Sea work\\r\\nfor me twice a day for ever. That will save paddling.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Eldest Magician laughed and said, ‘Payah kun’ (That is right).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Rat of the Moon stopped biting the line; and the Fisherman let\\r\\nhis line down till it touched the Sea, and he pulled the whole deep Sea\\r\\nalong, past the Island of Bintang, past Singapore, past Malacca, past\\r\\nSelangor, till the canoe whirled into the mouth of the Perak River\\r\\nagain. Kun?’ said the Fisherman of the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Payah kun,’ said the Eldest Magician. ‘See now that you pull the Sea\\r\\ntwice a day and twice a night for ever, so that the Malazy fishermen may\\r\\nbe saved paddling. But be careful not to do it too hard, or I shall make\\r\\na magic on you as I did to Pau Amma.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all went up the Perak River and went to bed, Best Beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow listen and attend!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that day to this the Moon has always pulled the sea up and down\\r\\nand made what we call the tides. Sometimes the Fisher of the Sea pulls a\\r\\nlittle too hard, and then we get spring tides; and sometimes he pulls\\r\\na little too softly, and then we get what are called neap-tides; but\\r\\nnearly always he is careful, because of the Eldest Magician.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Pau Amma? You can see when you go to the beach, how all Pau Amma’s\\r\\nbabies make little Pusat Taseks for themselves under every stone\\r\\nand bunch of weed on the sands; you can see them waving their little\\r\\nscissors; and in some parts of the world they truly live on the dry\\r\\nland and run up the palm trees and eat cocoa-nuts, exactly as the\\r\\ngirl-daughter promised. But once a year all Pau Ammas must shake off\\r\\ntheir hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the Eldest Magician\\r\\ncould do. And so it isn’t fair to kill or hunt Pau Amma’s babies just\\r\\nbecause old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yes! And Pau Amma’s babies hate being taken out of their little Pusat\\r\\nTaseks and brought home in pickle-bottles. That is why they nip you with\\r\\ntheir scissors, and it serves you right!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     CHINA-GOING P’s and O’s\\r\\n     Pass Pau Amma’s playground close,\\r\\n     And his Pusat Tasek lies\\r\\n     Near the track of most B.I.’s.\\r\\n     U.Y.K. and N.D.L.\\r\\n     Know Pau Amma’s home as well\\r\\n     As the fisher of the Sea knows\\r\\n     ‘Bens,’ M.M.’s, and Rubattinos.\\r\\n     But (and this is rather queer)\\r\\n     A.T.L.’s can not come here;\\r\\n     O. and O. and D.O.A.\\r\\n     Must go round another way.\\r\\n     Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,\\r\\n     Never go that way at all.\\r\\n     U.C.S. would have a fit\\r\\n     If it found itself on it.\\r\\n     And if ‘Beavers’ took their cargoes\\r\\n     To Penang instead of Lagos,\\r\\n     Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore\\r\\n     Passengers to Singapore,\\r\\n     Or a White Star were to try a\\r\\n     Little trip to Sourabaya,\\r\\n     Or a B.S.A. went on\\r\\n     Past Natal to Cheribon,\\r\\n     Then great Mr. Lloyds would come\\r\\n     With a wire and drag them home!\\r\\n\\r\\n     You’ll know what my riddle means\\r\\n     When you’ve eaten mangosteens.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr if you can’t wait till then, ask them to let you have the outside\\r\\npage of the Times; turn over to page 2 where it is marked ‘Shipping’\\r\\non the top left hand; then take the Atlas (and that is the finest\\r\\npicture-book in the world) and see how the names of the places that\\r\\nthe steamers go to fit into the names of the places on the map. Any\\r\\nsteamer-kiddy ought to be able to do that; but if you can’t read, ask\\r\\nsome one to show it you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CAT THAT WALKED BY HIMSELF\\r\\n\\r\\nHEAR and attend and listen; for this befell and behappened and became\\r\\nand was, O my Best Beloved, when the Tame animals were wild. The Dog was\\r\\nwild, and the Horse was wild, and the Cow was wild, and the Sheep was\\r\\nwild, and the Pig was wild--as wild as wild could be--and they walked in\\r\\nthe Wet Wild Woods by their wild lones. But the wildest of all the wild\\r\\nanimals was the Cat. He walked by himself, and all places were alike to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the Man was wild too. He was dreadfully wild. He didn’t even\\r\\nbegin to be tame till he met the Woman, and she told him that she\\r\\ndid not like living in his wild ways. She picked out a nice dry Cave,\\r\\ninstead of a heap of wet leaves, to lie down in; and she strewed clean\\r\\nsand on the floor; and she lit a nice fire of wood at the back of\\r\\nthe Cave; and she hung a dried wild-horse skin, tail-down, across the\\r\\nopening of the Cave; and she said, ‘Wipe you feet, dear, when you come\\r\\nin, and now we’ll keep house.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, Best Beloved, they ate wild sheep roasted on the hot stones,\\r\\nand flavoured with wild garlic and wild pepper; and wild duck stuffed\\r\\nwith wild rice and wild fenugreek and wild coriander; and marrow-bones\\r\\nof wild oxen; and wild cherries, and wild grenadillas. Then the Man\\r\\nwent to sleep in front of the fire ever so happy; but the Woman sat up,\\r\\ncombing her hair. She took the bone of the shoulder of mutton--the big\\r\\nfat blade-bone--and she looked at the wonderful marks on it, and she\\r\\nthrew more wood on the fire, and she made a Magic. She made the First\\r\\nSinging Magic in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut in the Wet Wild Woods all the wild animals gathered together where\\r\\nthey could see the light of the fire a long way off, and they wondered\\r\\nwhat it meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Wild Horse stamped with his wild foot and said, ‘O my Friends and O\\r\\nmy Enemies, why have the Man and the Woman made that great light in that\\r\\ngreat Cave, and what harm will it do us?’\\r\\n\\r\\nWild Dog lifted up his wild nose and smelled the smell of roast mutton,\\r\\nand said, ‘I will go up and see and look, and say; for I think it is\\r\\ngood. Cat, come with me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nenni!’ said the Cat. ‘I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all\\r\\nplaces are alike to me. I will not come.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then we can never be friends again,’ said Wild Dog, and he trotted off\\r\\nto the Cave. But when he had gone a little way the Cat said to himself,\\r\\n‘All places are alike to me. Why should I not go too and see and look\\r\\nand come away at my own liking.’ So he slipped after Wild Dog softly,\\r\\nvery softly, and hid himself where he could hear everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Wild Dog reached the mouth of the Cave he lifted up the dried\\r\\nhorse-skin with his nose and sniffed the beautiful smell of the roast\\r\\nmutton, and the Woman, looking at the blade-bone, heard him, and\\r\\nlaughed, and said, ‘Here comes the first. Wild Thing out of the Wild\\r\\nWoods, what do you want?’\\r\\n\\r\\nWild Dog said, ‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, what is this that\\r\\nsmells so good in the Wild Woods?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Woman picked up a roasted mutton-bone and threw it to Wild Dog,\\r\\nand said, ‘Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, taste and try.’ Wild Dog\\r\\ngnawed the bone, and it was more delicious than anything he had ever\\r\\ntasted, and he said, ‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, give me another.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman said, ‘Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, help my Man to hunt\\r\\nthrough the day and guard this Cave at night, and I will give you as\\r\\nmany roast bones as you need.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ said the Cat, listening. ‘This is a very wise Woman, but she is\\r\\nnot so wise as I am.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWild Dog crawled into the Cave and laid his head on the Woman’s lap, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘O my Friend and Wife of my Friend, I will help Your Man to hunt\\r\\nthrough the day, and at night I will guard your Cave.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ said the Cat, listening. ‘That is a very foolish Dog.’ And he went\\r\\nback through the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail, and walking by his\\r\\nwild lone. But he never told anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Man waked up he said, ‘What is Wild Dog doing here?’ And the\\r\\nWoman said, ‘His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend,\\r\\nbecause he will be our friend for always and always and always. Take him\\r\\nwith you when you go hunting.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNext night the Woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from the\\r\\nwater-meadows, and dried it before the fire, so that it smelt like\\r\\nnew-mown hay, and she sat at the mouth of the Cave and plaited a halter\\r\\nout of horse-hide, and she looked at the shoulder of mutton-bone--at the\\r\\nbig broad blade-bone--and she made a Magic. She made the Second Singing\\r\\nMagic in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut in the Wild Woods all the wild animals wondered what had happened to\\r\\nWild Dog, and at last Wild Horse stamped with his foot and said, ‘I will\\r\\ngo and see and say why Wild Dog has not returned. Cat, come with me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nenni!’ said the Cat. ‘I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all\\r\\nplaces are alike to me. I will not come.’ But all the same he followed\\r\\nWild Horse softly, very softly, and hid himself where he could hear\\r\\neverything.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Woman heard Wild Horse tripping and stumbling on his long mane,\\r\\nshe laughed and said, ‘Here comes the second. Wild Thing out of the Wild\\r\\nWoods what do you want?’\\r\\n\\r\\nWild Horse said, ‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where is Wild Dog?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman laughed, and picked up the blade-bone and looked at it, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, you did not come here for Wild\\r\\nDog, but for the sake of this good grass.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Wild Horse, tripping and stumbling on his long mane, said, ‘That is\\r\\ntrue; give it me to eat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman said, ‘Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, bend your wild head\\r\\nand wear what I give you, and you shall eat the wonderful grass three\\r\\ntimes a day.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Cat, listening, ‘this is a clever Woman, but she is not\\r\\nso clever as I am.’ Wild Horse bent his wild head, and the Woman slipped\\r\\nthe plaited hide halter over it, and Wild Horse breathed on the Woman’s\\r\\nfeet and said, ‘O my Mistress, and Wife of my Master, I will be your\\r\\nservant for the sake of the wonderful grass.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Cat, listening, ‘that is a very foolish Horse.’ And he\\r\\nwent back through the Wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail and walking\\r\\nby his wild lone. But he never told anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Man and the Dog came back from hunting, the Man said, ‘What is\\r\\nWild Horse doing here?’ And the Woman said, ‘His name is not Wild Horse\\r\\nany more, but the First Servant, because he will carry us from place\\r\\nto place for always and always and always. Ride on his back when you go\\r\\nhunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, holding her wild head high that her wild horns should not\\r\\ncatch in the wild trees, Wild Cow came up to the Cave, and the Cat\\r\\nfollowed, and hid himself just the same as before; and everything\\r\\nhappened just the same as before; and the Cat said the same things as\\r\\nbefore, and when Wild Cow had promised to give her milk to the Woman\\r\\nevery day in exchange for the wonderful grass, the Cat went back through\\r\\nthe Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone,\\r\\njust the same as before. But he never told anybody. And when the Man\\r\\nand the Horse and the Dog came home from hunting and asked the same\\r\\nquestions same as before, the Woman said, ‘Her name is not Wild Cow any\\r\\nmore, but the Giver of Good Food. She will give us the warm white milk\\r\\nfor always and always and always, and I will take care of her while you\\r\\nand the First Friend and the First Servant go hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the Cat waited to see if any other Wild thing would go up to\\r\\nthe Cave, but no one moved in the Wet Wild Woods, so the Cat walked\\r\\nthere by himself; and he saw the Woman milking the Cow, and he saw the\\r\\nlight of the fire in the Cave, and he smelt the smell of the warm white\\r\\nmilk.\\r\\n\\r\\nCat said, ‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where did Wild Cow go?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman laughed and said, ‘Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, go back\\r\\nto the Woods again, for I have braided up my hair, and I have put away\\r\\nthe magic blade-bone, and we have no more need of either friends or\\r\\nservants in our Cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCat said, ‘I am not a friend, and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who\\r\\nwalks by himself, and I wish to come into your cave.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWoman said, ‘Then why did you not come with First Friend on the first\\r\\nnight?’\\r\\n\\r\\nCat grew very angry and said, ‘Has Wild Dog told tales of me?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Woman laughed and said, ‘You are the Cat who walks by himself,\\r\\nand all places are alike to you. Your are neither a friend nor a\\r\\nservant. You have said it yourself. Go away and walk by yourself in all\\r\\nplaces alike.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Cat pretended to be sorry and said, ‘Must I never come into the\\r\\nCave? Must I never sit by the warm fire? Must I never drink the warm\\r\\nwhite milk? You are very wise and very beautiful. You should not be\\r\\ncruel even to a Cat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWoman said, ‘I knew I was wise, but I did not know I was beautiful. So I\\r\\nwill make a bargain with you. If ever I say one word in your praise you\\r\\nmay come into the Cave.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And if you say two words in my praise?’ said the Cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I never shall,’ said the Woman, ‘but if I say two words in your praise,\\r\\nyou may sit by the fire in the Cave.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And if you say three words?’ said the Cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I never shall,’ said the Woman, ‘but if I say three words in your\\r\\npraise, you may drink the warm white milk three times a day for always\\r\\nand always and always.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Cat arched his back and said, ‘Now let the Curtain at the mouth\\r\\nof the Cave, and the Fire at the back of the Cave, and the Milk-pots\\r\\nthat stand beside the Fire, remember what my Enemy and the Wife of my\\r\\nEnemy has said.’ And he went away through the Wet Wild Woods waving his\\r\\nwild tail and walking by his wild lone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night when the Man and the Horse and the Dog came home from\\r\\nhunting, the Woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had made\\r\\nwith the Cat, because she was afraid that they might not like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCat went far and far away and hid himself in the Wet Wild Woods by his\\r\\nwild lone for a long time till the Woman forgot all about him. Only the\\r\\nBat--the little upside-down Bat--that hung inside the Cave, knew where\\r\\nCat hid; and every evening Bat would fly to Cat with news of what was\\r\\nhappening.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening Bat said, ‘There is a Baby in the Cave. He is new and pink\\r\\nand fat and small, and the Woman is very fond of him.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Cat, listening, ‘but what is the Baby fond of?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He is fond of things that are soft and tickle,’ said the Bat. ‘He is\\r\\nfond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to sleep. He is\\r\\nfond of being played with. He is fond of all those things.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Cat, listening, ‘then my time has come.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNext night Cat walked through the Wet Wild Woods and hid very near the\\r\\nCave till morning-time, and Man and Dog and Horse went hunting. The\\r\\nWoman was busy cooking that morning, and the Baby cried and interrupted.\\r\\nSo she carried him outside the Cave and gave him a handful of pebbles to\\r\\nplay with. But still the Baby cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Cat put out his paddy paw and patted the Baby on the cheek, and\\r\\nit cooed; and the Cat rubbed against its fat knees and tickled it under\\r\\nits fat chin with his tail. And the Baby laughed; and the Woman heard\\r\\nhim and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Bat--the little upside-down bat--that hung in the mouth of the\\r\\nCave said, ‘O my Hostess and Wife of my Host and Mother of my Host’s\\r\\nSon, a Wild Thing from the Wild Woods is most beautifully playing with\\r\\nyour Baby.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A blessing on that Wild Thing whoever he may be,’ said the Woman,\\r\\nstraightening her back, ‘for I was a busy woman this morning and he has\\r\\ndone me a service.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very minute and second, Best Beloved, the dried horse-skin\\r\\nCurtain that was stretched tail-down at the mouth of the Cave fell\\r\\ndown--whoosh!--because it remembered the bargain she had made with the\\r\\nCat, and when the Woman went to pick it up--lo and behold!--the Cat was\\r\\nsitting quite comfy inside the Cave.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,’ said the Cat,\\r\\n‘it is I: for you have spoken a word in my praise, and now I can sit\\r\\nwithin the Cave for always and always and always. But still I am the Cat\\r\\nwho walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman was very angry, and shut her lips tight and took up her\\r\\nspinning-wheel and began to spin. But the Baby cried because the Cat had\\r\\ngone away, and the Woman could not hush it, for it struggled and kicked\\r\\nand grew black in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,’ said the Cat,\\r\\n‘take a strand of the wire that you are spinning and tie it to your\\r\\nspinning-whorl and drag it along the floor, and I will show you a magic\\r\\nthat shall make your Baby laugh as loudly as he is now crying.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I will do so,’ said the Woman, ‘because I am at my wits’ end; but I\\r\\nwill not thank you for it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tied the thread to the little clay spindle whorl and drew it across\\r\\nthe floor, and the Cat ran after it and patted it with his paws and\\r\\nrolled head over heels, and tossed it backward over his shoulder and\\r\\nchased it between his hind-legs and pretended to lose it, and pounced\\r\\ndown upon it again, till the Baby laughed as loudly as it had been\\r\\ncrying, and scrambled after the Cat and frolicked all over the Cave till\\r\\nit grew tired and settled down to sleep with the Cat in its arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now,’ said the Cat, ‘I will sing the Baby a song that shall keep him\\r\\nasleep for an hour. And he began to purr, loud and low, low and loud,\\r\\ntill the Baby fell fast asleep. The Woman smiled as she looked down upon\\r\\nthe two of them and said, ‘That was wonderfully done. No question but\\r\\nyou are very clever, O Cat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very minute and second, Best Beloved, the smoke of the fire at the\\r\\nback of the Cave came down in clouds from the roof--puff!--because\\r\\nit remembered the bargain she had made with the Cat, and when it had\\r\\ncleared away--lo and behold!--the Cat was sitting quite comfy close to\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of My Enemy,’ said the Cat,\\r\\n‘it is I, for you have spoken a second word in my praise, and now I can\\r\\nsit by the warm fire at the back of the Cave for always and always and\\r\\nalways. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are\\r\\nalike to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Woman was very very angry, and let down her hair and put more\\r\\nwood on the fire and brought out the broad blade-bone of the shoulder of\\r\\nmutton and began to make a Magic that should prevent her from saying\\r\\na third word in praise of the Cat. It was not a Singing Magic, Best\\r\\nBeloved, it was a Still Magic; and by and by the Cave grew so still that\\r\\na little wee-wee mouse crept out of a corner and ran across the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,’ said the Cat,\\r\\n‘is that little mouse part of your magic?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ouh! Chee! No indeed!’ said the Woman, and she dropped the blade-bone\\r\\nand jumped upon the footstool in front of the fire and braided up her\\r\\nhair very quick for fear that the mouse should run up it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Cat, watching, ‘then the mouse will do me no harm if I\\r\\neat it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ said the Woman, braiding up her hair, ‘eat it quickly and I will\\r\\never be grateful to you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nCat made one jump and caught the little mouse, and the Woman said,\\r\\n‘A hundred thanks. Even the First Friend is not quick enough to catch\\r\\nlittle mice as you have done. You must be very wise.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very moment and second, O Best Beloved, the Milk-pot that stood by\\r\\nthe fire cracked in two pieces--ffft--because it remembered the bargain\\r\\nshe had made with the Cat, and when the Woman jumped down from the\\r\\nfootstool--lo and behold!--the Cat was lapping up the warm white milk\\r\\nthat lay in one of the broken pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy, said the Cat,\\r\\n‘it is I; for you have spoken three words in my praise, and now I can\\r\\ndrink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and\\r\\nalways. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are\\r\\nalike to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm white milk and\\r\\nsaid, ‘O Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember that your bargain\\r\\nwas not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do not know what they will\\r\\ndo when they come home.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What is that to me?’ said the Cat. ‘If I have my place in the Cave by\\r\\nthe fire and my warm white milk three times a day I do not care what the\\r\\nMan or the Dog can do.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening when the Man and the Dog came into the Cave, the Woman\\r\\ntold them all the story of the bargain while the Cat sat by the fire and\\r\\nsmiled. Then the Man said, ‘Yes, but he has not made a bargain with me\\r\\nor with all proper Men after me.’ Then he took off his two leather boots\\r\\nand he took up his little stone axe (that makes three) and he fetched a\\r\\npiece of wood and a hatchet (that is five altogether), and he set them\\r\\nout in a row and he said, ‘Now we will make our bargain. If you do not\\r\\ncatch mice when you are in the Cave for always and always and always, I\\r\\nwill throw these five things at you whenever I see you, and so shall all\\r\\nproper Men do after me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Woman, listening, ‘this is a very clever Cat, but he is\\r\\nnot so clever as my Man.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cat counted the five things (and they looked very knobby) and he\\r\\nsaid, ‘I will catch mice when I am in the Cave for always and always and\\r\\nalways; but still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are\\r\\nalike to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not when I am near,’ said the Man. ‘If you had not said that last I\\r\\nwould have put all these things away for always and always and always;\\r\\nbut I am now going to throw my two boots and my little stone axe (that\\r\\nmakes three) at you whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper Men do\\r\\nafter me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Dog said, ‘Wait a minute. He has not made a bargain with me or\\r\\nwith all proper Dogs after me.’ And he showed his teeth and said, ‘If\\r\\nyou are not kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave for always and\\r\\nalways and always, I will hunt you till I catch you, and when I catch\\r\\nyou I will bite you. And so shall all proper Dogs do after me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the Woman, listening, ‘this is a very clever Cat, but he is\\r\\nnot so clever as the Dog.’\\r\\n\\r\\nCat counted the Dog’s teeth (and they looked very pointed) and he said,\\r\\n‘I will be kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave, as long as he does\\r\\nnot pull my tail too hard, for always and always and always. But still I\\r\\nam the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not when I am near,’ said the Dog. ‘If you had not said that last I\\r\\nwould have shut my mouth for always and always and always; but now I am\\r\\ngoing to hunt you up a tree whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper\\r\\nDogs do after me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Man threw his two boots and his little stone axe (that makes\\r\\nthree) at the Cat, and the Cat ran out of the Cave and the Dog chased\\r\\nhim up a tree; and from that day to this, Best Beloved, three proper Men\\r\\nout of five will always throw things at a Cat whenever they meet him,\\r\\nand all proper Dogs will chase him up a tree. But the Cat keeps his side\\r\\nof the bargain too. He will kill mice and he will be kind to Babies when\\r\\nhe is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard.\\r\\nBut when he has done that, and between times, and when the moon gets up\\r\\nand night comes, he is the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are\\r\\nalike to him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild Woods or up the Wet Wild\\r\\nTrees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his wild tail and walking by his\\r\\nwild lone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     PUSSY can sit by the fire and sing,\\r\\n       Pussy can climb a tree,\\r\\n     Or play with a silly old cork and string\\r\\n       To’muse herself, not me.\\r\\n     But I like Binkie my dog, because\\r\\n       He Lnows how to behave;\\r\\n     So, Binkie’s the same as the First Friend was,\\r\\n       And I am the Man in the Cave.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Pussy will play man-Friday till\\r\\n       It’s time to wet her paw\\r\\n     And make her walk on the window-sill\\r\\n       (For the footprint Crusoe saw);\\r\\n     Then she fluffles her tail and mews,\\r\\n       And scratches and won’t attend.\\r\\n     But Binkie will play whatever I choose,\\r\\n       And he is my true First Friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Pussy will rub my knees with her head\\r\\n       Pretending she loves me hard;\\r\\n     But the very minute I go to my bed\\r\\n       Pussy runs out in the yard,\\r\\n     And there she stays till the morning-light;\\r\\n       So I know it is only pretend;\\r\\n     But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,\\r\\n       And he is my Firstest Friend!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BUTTERFLY THAT STAMPED\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS, O my Best Beloved, is a story--a new and a wonderful story--a\\r\\nstory quite different from the other stories--a story about The Most\\r\\nWise Sovereign Suleiman-bin-Daoud--Solomon the Son of David.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three hundred and fifty-five stories about Suleiman-bin-Daoud;\\r\\nbut this is not one of them. It is not the story of the Lapwing who\\r\\nfound the Water; or the Hoopoe who shaded Suleimanbin-Daoud from the\\r\\nheat. It is not the story of the Glass Pavement, or the Ruby with\\r\\nthe Crooked Hole, or the Gold Bars of Balkis. It is the story of the\\r\\nButterfly that Stamped.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow attend all over again and listen!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud was wise. He understood what the beasts said, what\\r\\nthe birds said, what the fishes said, and what the insects said. He\\r\\nunderstood what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in\\r\\ntowards each other and groaned; and he understood what the trees\\r\\nsaid when they rustled in the middle of the morning. He understood\\r\\neverything, from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall, and\\r\\nBalkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful Queen Balkis, was nearly as\\r\\nwise as he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud was strong. Upon the third finger of the right hand\\r\\nhe wore a ring. When he turned it once, Afrits and Djinns came Out of\\r\\nthe earth to do whatever he told them. When he turned it twice, Fairies\\r\\ncame down from the sky to do whatever he told them; and when he turned\\r\\nit three times, the very great angel Azrael of the Sword came dressed\\r\\nas a water-carrier, and told him the news of the three worlds,\\r\\nAbove--Below--and Here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet Suleiman-bin-Daoud was not proud. He very seldom showed off, and\\r\\nwhen he did he was sorry for it. Once he tried to feed all the animals\\r\\nin all the world in one day, but when the food was ready an Animal came\\r\\nout of the deep sea and ate it up in three mouthfuls. Suleiman-bin-Daoud\\r\\nwas very surprised and said, ‘O Animal, who are you?’ And the Animal\\r\\nsaid, ‘O King, live for ever! I am the smallest of thirty thousand\\r\\nbrothers, and our home is at the bottom of the sea. We heard that you\\r\\nwere going to feed all the animals in all the world, and my brothers\\r\\nsent me to ask when dinner would be ready.’ Suleiman-bin-Daoud was more\\r\\nsurprised than ever and said, ‘O Animal, you have eaten all the dinner\\r\\nthat I made ready for all the animals in the world.’ And the Animal\\r\\nsaid, ‘O King, live for ever, but do you really call that a dinner?\\r\\nWhere I come from we each eat twice as much as that between meals.’ Then\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud fell flat on his face and said, ‘O Animal! I gave\\r\\nthat dinner to show what a great and rich king I was, and not because I\\r\\nreally wanted to be kind to the animals. Now I am ashamed, and it serves\\r\\nme right. Suleiman-bin-Daoud was a really truly wise man, Best Beloved.\\r\\nAfter that he never forgot that it was silly to show off; and now the\\r\\nreal story part of my story begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe married ever so many wifes. He married nine hundred and ninety-nine\\r\\nwives, besides the Most Beautiful Balkis; and they all lived in a great\\r\\ngolden palace in the middle of a lovely garden with fountains. He\\r\\ndidn’t really want nine-hundred and ninety-nine wives, but in those\\r\\ndays everybody married ever so many wives, and of course the King had to\\r\\nmarry ever so many more just to show that he was the King.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the wives were nice, but some were simply horrid, and the horrid\\r\\nones quarrelled with the nice ones and made them horrid too, and then\\r\\nthey would all quarrel with Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and that was horrid\\r\\nfor him. But Balkis the Most Beautiful never quarrelled with\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud. She loved him too much. She sat in her rooms in the\\r\\nGolden Palace, or walked in the Palace garden, and was truly sorry for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course if he had chosen to turn his ring on his finger and call\\r\\nup the Djinns and the Afrits they would have magicked all those nine\\r\\nhundred and ninety-nine quarrelsome wives into white mules of the desert\\r\\nor greyhounds or pomegranate seeds; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud thought that\\r\\nthat would be showing off. So, when they quarrelled too much, he only\\r\\nwalked by himself in one part of the beautiful Palace gardens and wished\\r\\nhe had never been born.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when they had quarrelled for three weeks--all nine hundred and\\r\\nninety-nine wives together--Suleiman-bin-Daoud went out for peace\\r\\nand quiet as usual; and among the orange trees he met Balkis the Most\\r\\nBeautiful, very sorrowful because Suleiman-bin-Daoud was so worried.\\r\\nAnd she said to him, ‘O my Lord and Light of my Eyes, turn the ring upon\\r\\nyour finger and show these Queens of Egypt and Mesopotamia and\\r\\nPersia and China that you are the great and terrible King.’ But\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud shook his head and said, ‘O my Lady and Delight of my\\r\\nLife, remember the Animal that came out of the sea and made me ashamed\\r\\nbefore all the animals in all the world because I showed off. Now, if\\r\\nI showed off before these Queens of Persia and Egypt and Abyssinia and\\r\\nChina, merely because they worry me, I might be made even more ashamed\\r\\nthan I have been.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Balkis the Most Beautiful said, ‘O my Lord and Treasure of my Soul,\\r\\nwhat will you do?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, ‘O my Lady and Content of my Heart, I\\r\\nshall continue to endure my fate at the hands of these nine hundred and\\r\\nninety-nine Queens who vex me with their continual quarrelling.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he went on between the lilies and the loquats and the roses and the\\r\\ncannas and the heavy-scented ginger-plants that grew in the garden, till\\r\\nhe came to the great camphor-tree that was called the Camphor Tree of\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud. But Balkis hid among the tall irises and the spotted\\r\\nbamboos and the red lillies behind the camphor-tree, so as to be near\\r\\nher own true love, Suleiman-bin-Daoud.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently two Butterflies flew under the tree, quarrelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud heard one say to the other, ‘I wonder at your\\r\\npresumption in talking like this to me. Don’t you know that if I stamped\\r\\nwith my foot all Suleiman-bin-Daoud’s Palace and this garden here would\\r\\nimmediately vanish in a clap of thunder.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Suleiman-bin-Daoud forgot his nine hundred and ninety-nine\\r\\nbothersome wives, and laughed, till the camphor-tree shook, at the\\r\\nButterfly’s boast. And he held out his finger and said, ‘Little man,\\r\\ncome here.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Butterfly was dreadfully frightened, but he managed to fly up to\\r\\nthe hand of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and clung there, fanning himself.\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud bent his head and whispered very softly, ‘Little man,\\r\\nyou know that all your stamping wouldn’t bend one blade of grass. What\\r\\nmade you tell that awful fib to your wife?--for doubtless she is your\\r\\nwife.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Butterfly looked at Suleiman-bin-Daoud and saw the most wise King’s\\r\\neye twinkle like stars on a frosty night, and he picked up his courage\\r\\nwith both wings, and he put his head on one side and said, ‘O King, live\\r\\nfor ever. She is my wife; and you know what wives are like.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud smiled in his beard and said, ‘Yes, I know, little\\r\\nbrother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘One must keep them in order somehow, said the Butterfly, and she has\\r\\nbeen quarrelling with me all the morning. I said that to quiet her.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, ‘May it quiet her. Go back to your wife,\\r\\nlittle brother, and let me hear what you say.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBack flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was all of a twitter behind\\r\\na leaf, and she said, ‘He heard you! Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself heard\\r\\nyou!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Heard me!’ said the Butterfly. ‘Of course he did. I meant him to hear\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And what did he say? Oh, what did he say?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said the Butterfly, fanning himself most importantly, ‘between\\r\\nyou and me, my dear--of course I don’t blame him, because his Palace\\r\\nmust have cost a great deal and the oranges are just ripening,--he asked\\r\\nme not to stamp, and I promised I wouldn’t.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Gracious!’ said his wife, and sat quite quiet; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud\\r\\nlaughed till the tears ran down his face at the impudence of the bad\\r\\nlittle Butterfly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalkis the Most Beautiful stood up behind the tree among the red lilies\\r\\nand smiled to herself, for she had heard all this talk. She thought,\\r\\n‘If I am wise I can yet save my Lord from the persecutions of these\\r\\nquarrelsome Queens,’ and she held out her finger and whispered softly to\\r\\nthe Butterfly’s Wife, ‘Little woman, come here.’ Up flew the Butterfly’s\\r\\nWife, very frightened, and clung to Balkis’s white hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalkis bent her beautiful head down and whispered, ‘Little woman, do you\\r\\nbelieve what your husband has just said?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Butterfly’s Wife looked at Balkis, and saw the most beautiful\\r\\nQueen’s eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on them, and she\\r\\npicked up her courage with both wings and said, ‘O Queen, be lovely for\\r\\never. You know what men-folk are like.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Queen Balkis, the Wise Balkis of Sheba, put her hand to her lips\\r\\nto hide a smile and said, ‘Little sister, I know.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘They get angry,’ said the Butterfly’s Wife, fanning herself quickly,\\r\\n‘over nothing at all, but we must humour them, O Queen. They never mean\\r\\nhalf they say. If it pleases my husband to believe that I believe he\\r\\ncan make Suleiman-bin-Daoud’s Palace disappear by stamping his foot, I’m\\r\\nsure I don’t care. He’ll forget all about it to-morrow.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Little sister,’ said Balkis, ‘you are quite right; but next time he\\r\\nbegins to boast, take him at his word. Ask him to stamp, and see what\\r\\nwill happen. We know what men-folk are like, don’t we? He’ll be very\\r\\nmuch ashamed.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAway flew the Butterfly’s Wife to her husband, and in five minutes they\\r\\nwere quarrelling worse than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Remember!’ said the Butterfly. ‘Remember what I can do if I stamp my\\r\\nfoot.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t believe you one little bit,’ said the Butterfly’s Wife. ‘I\\r\\nshould very much like to see it done. Suppose you stamp now.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I promised Suleiman-bin-Daoud that I wouldn’t,’ said the Butterfly,\\r\\n‘and I don’t want to break my promise.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It wouldn’t matter if you did,’ said his wife. ‘You couldn’t bend\\r\\na blade of grass with your stamping. I dare you to do it,’ she said.\\r\\nStamp! Stamp! Stamp!’\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud, sitting under the camphor-tree, heard every word\\r\\nof this, and he laughed as he had never laughed in his life before. He\\r\\nforgot all about his Queens; he forgot all about the Animal that came\\r\\nout of the sea; he forgot about showing off. He just laughed with joy,\\r\\nand Balkis, on the other side of the tree, smiled because her own true\\r\\nlove was so joyful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Butterfly, very hot and puffy, came whirling back under\\r\\nthe shadow of the camphor-tree and said to Suleiman, ‘She wants me to\\r\\nstamp! She wants to see what will happen, O Suleiman-bin-Daoud! You know\\r\\nI can’t do it, and now she’ll never believe a word I say. She’ll laugh\\r\\nat me to the end of my days!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, little brother,’ said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, ‘she will never laugh at\\r\\nyou again,’ and he turned the ring on his finger--just for the little\\r\\nButterfly’s sake, not for the sake of showing off,--and, lo and behold,\\r\\nfour huge Djinns came out of the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Slaves,’ said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, ‘when this gentleman on my finger’\\r\\n(that was where the impudent Butterfly was sitting) ‘stamps his left\\r\\nfront forefoot you will make my Palace and these gardens disappear in\\r\\na clap of thunder. When he stamps again you will bring them back\\r\\ncarefully.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now, little brother,’ he said, ‘go back to your wife and stamp all\\r\\nyou’ve a mind to.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAway flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was crying, ‘I dare you to do\\r\\nit! I dare you to do it! Stamp! Stamp now! Stamp!’ Balkis saw the four\\r\\nvast Djinns stoop down to the four corners of the gardens with the\\r\\nPalace in the middle, and she clapped her hands softly and said, ‘At\\r\\nlast Suleiman-bin-Daoud will do for the sake of a Butterfly what he\\r\\nought to have done long ago for his own sake, and the quarrelsome Queens\\r\\nwill be frightened!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe the butterfly stamped. The Djinns jerked the Palace and the gardens\\r\\na thousand miles into the air: there was a most awful thunder-clap, and\\r\\neverything grew inky-black. The Butterfly’s Wife fluttered about in the\\r\\ndark, crying, ‘Oh, I’ll be good! I’m so sorry I spoke. Only bring the\\r\\ngardens back, my dear darling husband, and I’ll never contradict again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Butterfly was nearly as frightened as his wife, and\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud laughed so much that it was several minutes before\\r\\nhe found breath enough to whisper to the Butterfly, ‘Stamp again, little\\r\\nbrother. Give me back my Palace, most great magician.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, give him back his Palace,’ said the Butterfly’s Wife, still flying\\r\\nabout in the dark like a moth. ‘Give him back his Palace, and don’t\\r\\nlet’s have any more horrid.magic.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, my dear,’ said the Butterfly as bravely as he could, ‘you see\\r\\nwhat your nagging has led to. Of course it doesn’t make any difference\\r\\nto me--I’m used to this kind of thing--but as a favour to you and to\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud I don’t mind putting things right.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he stamped once more, and that instant the Djinns let down the Palace\\r\\nand the gardens, without even a bump. The sun shone on the dark-green\\r\\norange leaves; the fountains played among the pink Egyptian lilies; the\\r\\nbirds went on singing, and the Butterfly’s Wife lay on her side under\\r\\nthe camphor-tree waggling her wings and panting, ‘Oh, I’ll be good! I’ll\\r\\nbe good!’\\r\\n\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daolld could hardly speak for laughing. He leaned back all\\r\\nweak and hiccoughy, and shook his finger at the Butterfly and said, ‘O\\r\\ngreat wizard, what is the sense of returning to me my Palace if at the\\r\\nsame time you slay me with mirth!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came a terrible noise, for all the nine hundred and ninety-nine\\r\\nQueens ran out of the Palace shrieking and shouting and calling for\\r\\ntheir babies. They hurried down the great marble steps below the\\r\\nfountain, one hundred abreast, and the Most Wise Balkis went statelily\\r\\nforward to meet them and said, ‘What is your trouble, O Queens?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood on the marble steps one hundred abreast and shouted, ‘What is\\r\\nour trouble? We were living peacefully in our golden palace, as is our\\r\\ncustom, when upon a sudden the Palace disappeared, and we were left\\r\\nsitting in a thick and noisome darkness; and it thundered, and Djinns\\r\\nand Afrits moved about in the darkness! That is our trouble, O Head\\r\\nQueen, and we are most extremely troubled on account of that trouble,\\r\\nfor it was a troublesome trouble, unlike any trouble we have known.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Balkis the Most Beautiful Queen--Suleiman-bin-Daoud’s Very Best\\r\\nBeloved--Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of the Gold\\r\\nof the South--from the Desert of Zinn to the Towers of Zimbabwe--Balkis,\\r\\nalmost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself, said, ‘It\\r\\nis nothing, O Queens! A Butterfly has made complaint against his\\r\\nwife because she quarrelled with him, and it has pleased our Lord\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud to teach her a lesson in low-speaking and humbleness,\\r\\nfor that is counted a virtue among the wives of the butterflies.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen up and spoke an Egyptian Queen--the daughter of a Pharoah--and she\\r\\nsaid, ‘Our Palace cannot be plucked up by the roots like a leek for the\\r\\nsake of a little insect. No! Suleiman-bin-Daoud must be dead, and what\\r\\nwe heard and saw was the earth thundering and darkening at the news.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Balkis beckoned that bold Queen without looking at her, and said to\\r\\nher and to the others, ‘Come and see.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came down the marble steps, one hundred abreast, and beneath his\\r\\ncamphor-tree, still weak with laughing, they saw the Most Wise King\\r\\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud rocking back and forth with a Butterfly on either\\r\\nhand, and they heard him say, ‘O wife of my brother in the air, remember\\r\\nafter this, to please your husband in all things, lest he be provoked to\\r\\nstamp his foot yet again; for he has said that he is used to this magic,\\r\\nand he is most eminently a great magician--one who steals away the very\\r\\nPalace of Suleirnan-bin-Daoud himself. Go in peace, little folk!’ And he\\r\\nkissed them on the wings, and they flew away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all the Queens except Balkis--the Most Beautiful and Splendid\\r\\nBalkis, who stood apart smiling--fell flat on their faces, for they\\r\\nsaid, ‘If these things are done when a Butterfly is displeased with\\r\\nhis wife, what shall be done to us who have vexed our King with our\\r\\nloud-speaking and open quarrelling through many days?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they put their veils over their heads, and they put their hands\\r\\nover their mouths, and they tiptoed back to the Palace most mousy-quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Balkis--The Most Beautiful and Excellent Balkis--went forward\\r\\nthrough the red lilies into the shade of the camphor-tree and laid\\r\\nher hand upon Suleiman-bin-Daoud’s shoulder and said, ‘O my Lord and\\r\\nTreasure of my Soul, rejoice, for we have taught the Queens of Egypt and\\r\\nEthiopia and Abyssinia and Persia and India and China with a great and a\\r\\nmemorable teaching.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Suleiman-bin-Daoud, still looking after the Butterflies where they\\r\\nplayed in the sunlight, said, ‘O my Lady and Jewel of my Felicity, when\\r\\ndid this happen? For I have been jesting with a Butterfly ever since I\\r\\ncame into the garden.’ And he told Balkis what he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalkis--The tender and Most Lovely Balkis--said, ‘O my Lord and Regent\\r\\nof my Existence, I hid behind the camphor-tree and saw it all. It was I\\r\\nwho told the Butterfly’s Wife to ask the Butterfly to stamp, because I\\r\\nhoped that for the sake of the jest my Lord would make some great magic\\r\\nand that the Queens would see it and be frightened.’ And she told him\\r\\nwhat the Queens had said and seen and thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Suleiman-bin-Daoud rose up from his seat under the camphor-tree,\\r\\nand stretched his arms and rejoiced and said, ‘O my Lady and Sweetener\\r\\nof my Days, know that if I had made a magic against my Queens for the\\r\\nsake of pride or anger, as I made that feast for all the animals, I\\r\\nshould certainly have been put to shame. But by means of your wisdom\\r\\nI made the magic for the sake of a jest and for the sake of a little\\r\\nButterfly, and--behold--it has also delivered me from the vexations of\\r\\nmy vexatious wives! Tell me, therefore, O my Lady and Heart of my Heart,\\r\\nhow did you come to be so wise?’ And Balkis the Queen, beautiful and\\r\\ntall, looked up into Suleiman-bin-Daoud’s eyes and put her head a little\\r\\non one side, just like the Butterfly, and said, ‘First, O my Lord,\\r\\nbecause I loved you; and secondly, O my Lord, because I know what\\r\\nwomen-folk are.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they went up to the Palace and lived happily ever afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wasn’t it clever of Balkis?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     THERE was never a Queen like Balkis,\\r\\n       From here to the wide world’s end;\\r\\n     But Balkis talked to a butterfly\\r\\n       As you would talk to a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n     There was never a King like Solomon,\\r\\n       Not since the world began;\\r\\n     But Solomon talked to a butterfly\\r\\n       As a man would talk to a man.\\r\\n\\r\\n     She was Queen of Sabaea--\\r\\n       And he was Asia’s Lord--\\r\\n     But they both of ‘em talked to butterflies\\r\\n       When they took their walks abroad!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

              "'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCHOOLMISTRESS\\r\\n\\r\\nAT half-past eight they drove out of the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highroad was dry, a lovely April sun was shining warmly, but the\\r\\nsnow was still lying in the ditches and in the woods. Winter, dark,\\r\\nlong, and spiteful, was hardly over; spring had come all of a sudden.\\r\\nBut neither the warmth nor the languid transparent woods, warmed by the\\r\\nbreath of spring, nor the black flocks of birds flying over the huge\\r\\npuddles that were like lakes, nor the marvelous fathomless sky, into\\r\\nwhich it seemed one would have gone away so joyfully, presented anything\\r\\nnew or interesting to Marya Vassilyevna who was sitting in the cart. For\\r\\nthirteen years she had been schoolmistress, and there was no reckoning\\r\\nhow many times during all those years she had been to the town for her\\r\\nsalary; and whether it were spring as now, or a rainy autumn evening, or\\r\\nwinter, it was all the same to her, and she always--invariably--longed\\r\\nfor one thing only, to get to the end of her journey as quickly as could\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt as though she had been living in that part of the country for\\r\\nages and ages, for a hundred years, and it seemed to her that she knew\\r\\nevery stone, every tree on the road from the town to her school. Her\\r\\npast was here, her present was here, and she could imagine no other\\r\\nfuture than the school, the road to the town and back again, and again\\r\\nthe school and again the road....\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had got out of the habit of thinking of her past before she became\\r\\na schoolmistress, and had almost forgotten it. She had once had a father\\r\\nand mother; they had lived in Moscow in a big flat near the Red Gate,\\r\\nbut of all that life there was left in her memory only something vague\\r\\nand fluid like a dream. Her father had died when she was ten years old,\\r\\nand her mother had died soon after.... She had a brother, an officer;\\r\\nat first they used to write to each other, then her brother had given up\\r\\nanswering her letters, he had got out of the way of writing. Of her old\\r\\nbelongings, all that was left was a photograph of her mother, but it had\\r\\ngrown dim from the dampness of the school, and now nothing could be seen\\r\\nbut the hair and the eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had driven a couple of miles, old Semyon, who was driving,\\r\\nturned round and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have caught a government clerk in the town. They have taken him\\r\\naway. The story is that with some Germans he killed Alexeyev, the Mayor,\\r\\nin Moscow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who told you that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were reading it in the paper, in Ivan Ionov’s tavern.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again they were silent for a long time. Marya Vassilyevna thought of\\r\\nher school, of the examination that was coming soon, and of the girl and\\r\\nfour boys she was sending up for it. And just as she was thinking about\\r\\nthe examination, she was overtaken by a neighboring landowner called\\r\\nHanov in a carriage with four horses, the very man who had been examiner\\r\\nin her school the year before. When he came up to her he recognized her\\r\\nand bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-morning,” he said to her. “You are driving home, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Hanov, a man of forty with a listless expression and a face that\\r\\nshowed signs of wear, was beginning to look old, but was still handsome\\r\\nand admired by women. He lived in his big homestead alone, and was not\\r\\nin the service; and people used to say of him that he did nothing at\\r\\nhome but walk up and down the room whistling, or play chess with his\\r\\nold footman. People said, too, that he drank heavily. And indeed at the\\r\\nexamination the year before the very papers he brought with him smelt of\\r\\nwine and scent. He had been dressed all in new clothes on that occasion,\\r\\nand Marya Vassilyevna thought him very attractive, and all the while\\r\\nshe sat beside him she had felt embarrassed. She was accustomed to see\\r\\nfrigid and sensible examiners at the school, while this one did not\\r\\nremember a single prayer, or know what to ask questions about, and\\r\\nwas exceedingly courteous and delicate, giving nothing but the highest\\r\\nmarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going to visit Bakvist,” he went on, addressing Marya Vassilyevna,\\r\\n“but I am told he is not at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey turned off the highroad into a by-road to the village, Hanov\\r\\nleading the way and Semyon following. The four horses moved at a walking\\r\\npace, with effort dragging the heavy carriage through the mud. Semyon\\r\\ntacked from side to side, keeping to the edge of the road, at one time\\r\\nthrough a snowdrift, at another through a pool, often jumping out of the\\r\\ncart and helping the horse. Marya Vassilyevna was still thinking\\r\\nabout the school, wondering whether the arithmetic questions at the\\r\\nexamination would be difficult or easy. And she felt annoyed with\\r\\nthe Zemstvo board at which she had found no one the day before. How\\r\\nunbusiness-like! Here she had been asking them for the last two years\\r\\nto dismiss the watchman, who did nothing, was rude to her, and hit\\r\\nthe schoolboys; but no one paid any attention. It was hard to find the\\r\\npresident at the office, and when one did find him he would say with\\r\\ntears in his eyes that he hadn’t a moment to spare; the inspector\\r\\nvisited the school at most once in three years, and knew nothing\\r\\nwhatever about his work, as he had been in the Excise Duties Department,\\r\\nand had received the post of school inspector through influence. The\\r\\nSchool Council met very rarely, and there was no knowing where it met;\\r\\nthe school guardian was an almost illiterate peasant, the head of\\r\\na tanning business, unintelligent, rude, and a great friend of the\\r\\nwatchman’s--and goodness knows to whom she could appeal with complaints\\r\\nor inquiries....\\r\\n\\r\\n“He really is handsome,” she thought, glancing at Hanov.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road grew worse and worse.... They drove into the wood. Here\\r\\nthere was no room to turn round, the wheels sank deeply in, water\\r\\nsplashed and gurgled through them, and sharp twigs struck them in the\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a road!” said Hanov, and he laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schoolmistress looked at him and could not understand why this queer\\r\\nman lived here. What could his money, his interesting appearance, his\\r\\nrefined bearing do for him here, in this mud, in this God-forsaken,\\r\\ndreary place? He got no special advantages out of life, and here, like\\r\\nSemyon, was driving at a jog-trot on an appalling road and enduring\\r\\nthe same discomforts. Why live here if one could live in Petersburg or\\r\\nabroad? And one would have thought it would be nothing for a rich man\\r\\nlike him to make a good road instead of this bad one, to avoid enduring\\r\\nthis misery and seeing the despair on the faces of his coachman and\\r\\nSemyon; but he only laughed, and apparently did not mind, and wanted no\\r\\nbetter life. He was kind, soft, naive, and he did not understand this\\r\\ncoarse life, just as at the examination he did not know the prayers.\\r\\nHe subscribed nothing to the schools but globes, and genuinely regarded\\r\\nhimself as a useful person and a prominent worker in the cause of\\r\\npopular education. And what use were his globes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold on, Vassilyevna!” said Semyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cart lurched violently and was on the point of upsetting; something\\r\\nheavy rolled on to Marya Vassilyevna’s feet--it was her parcel of\\r\\npurchases. There was a steep ascent uphill through the clay; here in the\\r\\nwinding ditches rivulets were gurgling. The water seemed to have gnawed\\r\\naway the road; and how could one get along here! The horses breathed\\r\\nhard. Hanov got out of his carriage and walked at the side of the road\\r\\nin his long overcoat. He was hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a road!” he said, and laughed again. “It would soon smash up one’s\\r\\ncarriage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody obliges you to drive about in such weather,” said Semyon\\r\\nsurlily. “You should stay at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am dull at home, grandfather. I don’t like staying at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside old Semyon he looked graceful and vigorous, but yet in his walk\\r\\nthere was something just perceptible which betrayed in him a being\\r\\nalready touched by decay, weak, and on the road to ruin. And all at once\\r\\nthere was a whiff of spirits in the wood. Marya Vassilyevna was filled\\r\\nwith dread and pity for this man going to his ruin for no visible cause\\r\\nor reason, and it came into her mind that if she had been his wife or\\r\\nsister she would have devoted her whole life to saving him from ruin.\\r\\nHis wife! Life was so ordered that here he was living in his great house\\r\\nalone, and she was living in a God-forsaken village alone, and yet\\r\\nfor some reason the mere thought that he and she might be close to one\\r\\nanother and equals seemed impossible and absurd. In reality, life was\\r\\narranged and human relations were complicated so utterly beyond all\\r\\nunderstanding that when one thought about it one felt uncanny and one’s\\r\\nheart sank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it is beyond all understanding,” she thought, “why God gives\\r\\nbeauty, this graciousness, and sad, sweet eyes to weak, unlucky, useless\\r\\npeople--why they are so charming.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here we must turn off to the right,” said Hanov, getting into his\\r\\ncarriage. “Good-by! I wish you all things good!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again she thought of her pupils, of the examination, of the\\r\\nwatchman, of the School Council; and when the wind brought the sound\\r\\nof the retreating carriage these thoughts were mingled with others. She\\r\\nlonged to think of beautiful eyes, of love, of the happiness which would\\r\\nnever be....\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife? It was cold in the morning, there was no one to heat the\\r\\nstove, the watchman disappeared; the children came in as soon as it\\r\\nwas light, bringing in snow and mud and making a noise: it was all so\\r\\ninconvenient, so comfortless. Her abode consisted of one little room and\\r\\nthe kitchen close by. Her head ached every day after her work, and\\r\\nafter dinner she had heart-burn. She had to collect money from the\\r\\nschool-children for wood and for the watchman, and to give it to\\r\\nthe school guardian, and then to entreat him--that overfed, insolent\\r\\npeasant--for God’s sake to send her wood. And at night she dreamed of\\r\\nexaminations, peasants, snowdrifts. And this life was making her grow\\r\\nold and coarse, making her ugly, angular, and awkward, as though she\\r\\nwere made of lead. She was always afraid, and she would get up from\\r\\nher seat and not venture to sit down in the presence of a member of\\r\\nthe Zemstvo or the school guardian. And she used formal, deferential\\r\\nexpressions when she spoke of any one of them. And no one thought her\\r\\nattractive, and life was passing drearily, without affection, without\\r\\nfriendly sympathy, without interesting acquaintances. How awful it would\\r\\nhave been in her position if she had fallen in love!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold on, Vassilyevna!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a sharp ascent uphill....\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had become a schoolmistress from necessity, without feeling any\\r\\nvocation for it; and she had never thought of a vocation, of serving the\\r\\ncause of enlightenment; and it always seemed to her that what was most\\r\\nimportant in her work was not the children, nor enlightenment, but the\\r\\nexaminations. And what time had she for thinking of vocation, of serving\\r\\nthe cause of enlightenment? Teachers, badly paid doctors, and their\\r\\nassistants, with their terribly hard work, have not even the comfort of\\r\\nthinking that they are serving an idea or the people, as their heads are\\r\\nalways stuffed with thoughts of their daily bread, of wood for the fire,\\r\\nof bad roads, of illnesses. It is a hard-working, an uninteresting life,\\r\\nand only silent, patient cart-horses like Mary Vassilyevna could put up\\r\\nwith it for long; the lively, nervous, impressionable people who talked\\r\\nabout vocation and serving the idea were soon weary of it and gave up\\r\\nthe work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemyon kept picking out the driest and shortest way, first by a meadow,\\r\\nthen by the backs of the village huts; but in one place the peasants\\r\\nwould not let them pass, in another it was the priest’s land and they\\r\\ncould not cross it, in another Ivan Ionov had bought a plot from the\\r\\nlandowner and had dug a ditch round it. They kept having to turn back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached Nizhneye Gorodistche. Near the tavern on the dung-strewn\\r\\nearth, where the snow was still lying, there stood wagons that had\\r\\nbrought great bottles of crude sulphuric acid. There were a great many\\r\\npeople in the tavern, all drivers, and there was a smell of vodka,\\r\\ntobacco, and sheepskins. There was a loud noise of conversation and\\r\\nthe banging of the swing-door. Through the wall, without ceasing for a\\r\\nmoment, came the sound of a concertina being played in the shop.\\r\\nMarya Vassilyevna sat down and drank some tea, while at the next table\\r\\npeasants were drinking vodka and beer, perspiring from the tea they had\\r\\njust swallowed and the stifling fumes of the tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, Kuzma!” voices kept shouting in confusion. “What there!” “The\\r\\nLord bless us!” “Ivan Dementyitch, I can tell you that!” “Look out, old\\r\\nman!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA little pock-marked man with a black beard, who was quite drunk, was\\r\\nsuddenly surprised by something and began using bad language.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you swearing at, you there?” Semyon, who was sitting some way\\r\\noff, responded angrily. “Don’t you see the young lady?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The young lady!” someone mimicked in another corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Swinish crow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We meant nothing...” said the little man in confusion. “I beg\\r\\nyour pardon. We pay with our money and the young lady with hers.\\r\\nGood-morning!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-morning,” answered the schoolmistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And we thank you most feelingly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarya Vassilyevna drank her tea with satisfaction, and she, too,\\r\\nbegan turning red like the peasants, and fell to thinking again about\\r\\nfirewood, about the watchman....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay, old man,” she heard from the next table, “it’s the schoolmistress\\r\\nfrom Vyazovye.... We know her; she’s a good young lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s all right!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swing-door was continually banging, some coming in, others going\\r\\nout. Marya Vassilyevna sat on, thinking all the time of the same\\r\\nthings, while the concertina went on playing and playing. The patches of\\r\\nsunshine had been on the floor, then they passed to the counter, to the\\r\\nwall, and disappeared altogether; so by the sun it was past midday. The\\r\\npeasants at the next table were getting ready to go. The little man,\\r\\nsomewhat unsteadily, went up to Marya Vassilyevna and held out his hand\\r\\nto her; following his example, the others shook hands, too, at parting,\\r\\nand went out one after another, and the swing-door squeaked and slammed\\r\\nnine times.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Vassilyevna, get ready,” Semyon called to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey set off. And again they went at a walking pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A little while back they were building a school here in their Nizhneye\\r\\nGorodistche,” said Semyon, turning round. “It was a wicked thing that\\r\\nwas done!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say the president put a thousand in his pocket, and the school\\r\\nguardian another thousand in his, and the teacher five hundred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The whole school only cost a thousand. It’s wrong to slander people,\\r\\ngrandfather. That’s all nonsense.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,... I only tell you what folks say.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was clear that Semyon did not believe the schoolmistress. The\\r\\npeasants did not believe her. They always thought she received too large\\r\\na salary, twenty-one roubles a month (five would have been enough), and\\r\\nthat of the money that she collected from the children for the firewood\\r\\nand the watchman the greater part she kept for herself. The guardian\\r\\nthought the same as the peasants, and he himself made a profit off\\r\\nthe firewood and received payments from the peasants for being a\\r\\nguardian--without the knowledge of the authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forest, thank God! was behind them, and now it would be flat, open\\r\\nground all the way to Vyazovye, and there was not far to go now. They\\r\\nhad to cross the river and then the railway line, and then Vyazovye was\\r\\nin sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you driving?” Marya Vassilyevna asked Semyon. “Take the road\\r\\nto the right to the bridge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, we can go this way as well. It’s not deep enough to matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mind you don’t drown the horse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, Hanov is driving to the bridge,” said Marya Vassilyevna, seeing\\r\\nthe four horses far away to the right. “It is he, I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is. So he didn’t find Bakvist at home. What a pig-headed fellow he\\r\\nis. Lord have mercy upon us! He’s driven over there, and what for? It’s\\r\\nfully two miles nearer this way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached the river. In the summer it was a little stream easily\\r\\ncrossed by wading. It usually dried up in August, but now, after the\\r\\nspring floods, it was a river forty feet in breadth, rapid, muddy, and\\r\\ncold; on the bank and right up to the water there were fresh tracks of\\r\\nwheels, so it had been crossed here.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on!” shouted Semyon angrily and anxiously, tugging violently at the\\r\\nreins and jerking his elbows as a bird does its wings. “Go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse went on into the water up to his belly and stopped, but at\\r\\nonce went on again with an effort, and Marya Vassilyevna was aware of a\\r\\nkeen chilliness in her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on!” she, too, shouted, getting up. “Go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey got out on the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nice mess it is, Lord have mercy upon us!” muttered Semyon, setting\\r\\nstraight the harness. “It’s a perfect plague with this Zemstvo....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer shoes and goloshes were full of water, the lower part of her dress\\r\\nand of her coat and one sleeve were wet and dripping: the sugar and\\r\\nflour had got wet, and that was worst of all, and Marya Vassilyevna\\r\\ncould only clasp her hands in despair and say:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Semyon, Semyon! How tiresome you are really!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrier was down at the railway crossing. A train was coming out\\r\\nof the station. Marya Vassilyevna stood at the crossing waiting till\\r\\nit should pass, and shivering all over with cold. Vyazovye was in sight\\r\\nnow, and the school with the green roof, and the church with its crosses\\r\\nflashing in the evening sun: and the station windows flashed too, and\\r\\na pink smoke rose from the engine... and it seemed to her that\\r\\neverything was trembling with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was the train; the windows reflected the gleaming light like the\\r\\ncrosses on the church: it made her eyes ache to look at them. On the\\r\\nlittle platform between two first-class carriages a lady was standing,\\r\\nand Marya Vassilyevna glanced at her as she passed. Her mother! What a\\r\\nresemblance! Her mother had had just such luxuriant hair, just such a\\r\\nbrow and bend of the head. And with amazing distinctness, for the first\\r\\ntime in those thirteen years, there rose before her mind a vivid picture\\r\\nof her mother, her father, her brother, their flat in Moscow, the\\r\\naquarium with little fish, everything to the tiniest detail; she heard\\r\\nthe sound of the piano, her father’s voice; she felt as she had been\\r\\nthen, young, good-looking, well-dressed, in a bright warm room among her\\r\\nown people. A feeling of joy and happiness suddenly came over her,\\r\\nshe pressed her hands to her temples in an ecstacy, and called softly,\\r\\nbeseechingly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she began crying, she did not know why. Just at that instant Hanov\\r\\ndrove up with his team of four horses, and seeing him she imagined\\r\\nhappiness such as she had never had, and smiled and nodded to him as\\r\\nan equal and a friend, and it seemed to her that her happiness, her\\r\\ntriumph, was glowing in the sky and on all sides, in the windows and on\\r\\nthe trees. Her father and mother had never died, she had never been a\\r\\nschoolmistress, it was a long, tedious, strange dream, and now she had\\r\\nawakened....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Vassilyevna, get in!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at once it all vanished. The barrier was slowly raised. Marya\\r\\nVassilyevna, shivering and numb with cold, got into the cart. The\\r\\ncarriage with the four horses crossed the railway line; Semyon followed\\r\\nit. The signalman took off his cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And here is Vyazovye. Here we are.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA NERVOUS BREAKDOWN\\r\\n\\r\\nA MEDICAL student called Mayer, and a pupil of the Moscow School of\\r\\nPainting, Sculpture, and Architecture called Rybnikov, went one evening\\r\\nto see their friend Vassilyev, a law student, and suggested that he\\r\\nshould go with them to S. Street. For a long time Vassilyev would not\\r\\nconsent to go, but in the end he put on his greatcoat and went with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew nothing of fallen women except by hearsay and from books, and\\r\\nhe had never in his life been in the houses in which they live. He\\r\\nknew that there are immoral women who, under the pressure of fatal\\r\\ncircumstances--environment, bad education, poverty, and so on--are\\r\\nforced to sell their honor for money. They know nothing of pure love,\\r\\nhave no children, have no civil rights; their mothers and sisters weep\\r\\nover them as though they were dead, science treats of them as an evil,\\r\\nmen address them with contemptuous familiarity. But in spite of\\r\\nall that, they do not lose the semblance and image of God. They all\\r\\nacknowledge their sin and hope for salvation. Of the means that lead to\\r\\nsalvation they can avail themselves to the fullest extent. Society, it\\r\\nis true, will not forgive people their past, but in the sight of God St.\\r\\nMary of Egypt is no lower than the other saints. When it had happened\\r\\nto Vassilyev in the street to recognize a fallen woman as such, by her\\r\\ndress or her manners, or to see a picture of one in a comic paper,\\r\\nhe always remembered a story he had once read: a young man, pure and\\r\\nself-sacrificing, loves a fallen woman and urges her to become his wife;\\r\\nshe, considering herself unworthy of such happiness, takes poison.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev lived in one of the side streets turning out of Tverskoy\\r\\nBoulevard. When he came out of the house with his two friends it was\\r\\nabout eleven o’clock. The first snow had not long fallen, and all nature\\r\\nwas under the spell of the fresh snow. There was the smell of snow in\\r\\nthe air, the snow crunched softly under the feet; the earth, the roofs,\\r\\nthe trees, the seats on the boulevard, everything was soft, white,\\r\\nyoung, and this made the houses look quite different from the day\\r\\nbefore; the street lamps burned more brightly, the air was more\\r\\ntransparent, the carriages rumbled with a deeper note, and with the\\r\\nfresh, light, frosty air a feeling stirred in the soul akin to the\\r\\nwhite, youthful, feathery snow. “Against my will an unknown force,”\\r\\n hummed the medical student in his agreeable tenor, “has led me to these\\r\\nmournful shores.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behold the mill...” the artist seconded him, “in ruins now....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behold the mill... in ruins now,” the medical student repeated,\\r\\nraising his eyebrows and shaking his head mournfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, rubbed his forehead, trying to remember the words, and then\\r\\nsang aloud, so well that passers-by looked round:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Here in old days when I was free,\\r\\n     Love, free, unfettered, greeted me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three of them went into a restaurant and, without taking off their\\r\\ngreatcoats, drank a couple of glasses of vodka each. Before drinking the\\r\\nsecond glass, Vassilyev noticed a bit of cork in his vodka, raised the\\r\\nglass to his eyes, and gazed into it for a long time, screwing up\\r\\nhis shortsighted eyes. The medical student did not understand his\\r\\nexpression, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, why look at it? No philosophizing, please. Vodka is given us to\\r\\nbe drunk, sturgeon to be eaten, women to be visited, snow to be walked\\r\\nupon. For one evening anyway live like a human being!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I haven’t said anything...” said Vassilyev, laughing. “Am I\\r\\nrefusing to?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a warmth inside him from the vodka. He looked with softened\\r\\nfeelings at his friends, admired them and envied them. In these strong,\\r\\nhealthy, cheerful people how wonderfully balanced everything is, how\\r\\nfinished and smooth is everything in their minds and souls! They sing,\\r\\nand have a passion for the theatre, and draw, and talk a great deal,\\r\\nand drink, and they don’t have headaches the day after; they are both\\r\\npoetical and debauched, both soft and hard; they can work, too, and be\\r\\nindignant, and laugh without reason, and talk nonsense; they are warm,\\r\\nhonest, self-sacrificing, and as men are in no way inferior to himself,\\r\\nVassilyev, who watched over every step he took and every word he\\r\\nuttered, who was fastidious and cautious, and ready to raise every\\r\\ntrifle to the level of a problem. And he longed for one evening to\\r\\nlive as his friends did, to open out, to let himself loose from his own\\r\\ncontrol. If vodka had to be drunk, he would drink it, though his head\\r\\nwould be splitting next morning. If he were taken to the women he would\\r\\ngo. He would laugh, play the fool, gaily respond to the passing advances\\r\\nof strangers in the street....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went out of the restaurant laughing. He liked his friends--one in a\\r\\ncrushed broad-brimmed hat, with an affectation of artistic untidiness;\\r\\nthe other in a sealskin cap, a man not poor, though he affected to\\r\\nbelong to the Bohemia of learning. He liked the snow, the pale street\\r\\nlamps, the sharp black tracks left in the first snow by the feet of the\\r\\npassers-by. He liked the air, and especially that limpid, tender, naive,\\r\\nas it were virginal tone, which can be seen in nature only twice in the\\r\\nyear--when everything is covered with snow, and in spring on bright days\\r\\nand moonlight evenings when the ice breaks on the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Against my will an unknown force,\\r\\n     Has led me to these mournful shores,”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe hummed in an undertone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the tune for some reason haunted him and his friends all the way,\\r\\nand all three of them hummed it mechanically, not in time with one\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev’s imagination was picturing how, in another ten minutes, he\\r\\nand his friends would knock at a door; how by little dark passages and\\r\\ndark rooms they would steal in to the women; how, taking advantage of\\r\\nthe darkness, he would strike a match, would light up and see the\\r\\nface of a martyr and a guilty smile. The unknown, fair or dark, would\\r\\ncertainly have her hair down and be wearing a white dressing-jacket; she\\r\\nwould be panic-stricken by the light, would be fearfully confused, and\\r\\nwould say: “For God’s sake, what are you doing! Put it out!” It would\\r\\nall be dreadful, but interesting and new.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friends turned out of Trubnoy Square into Gratchevka, and soon\\r\\nreached the side street which Vassilyev only knew by reputation. Seeing\\r\\ntwo rows of houses with brightly lighted windows and wide-open doors,\\r\\nand hearing gay strains of pianos and violins, sounds which floated\\r\\nout from every door and mingled in a strange chaos, as though an unseen\\r\\norchestra were tuning up in the darkness above the roofs, Vassilyev was\\r\\nsurprised and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a lot of houses!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nothing,” said the medical student. “In London there are ten\\r\\ntimes as many. There are about a hundred thousand such women there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cabmen were sitting on their boxes as calmly and indifferently as\\r\\nin any other side street; the same passers-by were walking along the\\r\\npavement as in other streets. No one was hurrying, no one was hiding his\\r\\nface in his coat-collar, no one shook his head reproachfully.... And\\r\\nin this indifference to the noisy chaos of pianos and violins, to the\\r\\nbright windows and wide-open doors, there was a feeling of something\\r\\nvery open, insolent, reckless, and devil-may-care. Probably it was as\\r\\ngay and noisy at the slave-markets in their day, and people’s faces and\\r\\nmovements showed the same indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us begin from the beginning,” said the artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friends went into a narrow passage lighted by a lamp with a\\r\\nreflector. When they opened the door a man in a black coat, with an\\r\\nunshaven face like a flunkey’s, and sleepy-looking eyes, got up lazily\\r\\nfrom a yellow sofa in the hall. The place smelt like a laundry with an\\r\\nodor of vinegar in addition. A door from the hall led into a brightly\\r\\nlighted room. The medical student and the artist stopped at this door\\r\\nand, craning their necks, peeped into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Buona sera, signori, rigolleto--hugenotti--traviata!” began the artist,\\r\\nwith a theatrical bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Havanna--tarakano--pistoleto!” said the medical student, pressing his\\r\\ncap to his breast and bowing low.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev was standing behind them. He would have liked to make a\\r\\ntheatrical bow and say something silly, too, but he only smiled, felt an\\r\\nawkwardness that was like shame, and waited impatiently for what would\\r\\nhappen next.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little fair girl of seventeen or eighteen, with short hair, in a short\\r\\nlight-blue frock with a bunch of white ribbon on her bosom, appeared in\\r\\nthe doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you stand at the door?” she said. “Take off your coats and come\\r\\ninto the drawing-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical student and the artist, still talking Italian, went into the\\r\\ndrawing-room. Vassilyev followed them irresolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gentlemen, take off your coats!” the flunkey said sternly; “you can’t\\r\\ngo in like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the drawing-room there was, besides the girl, another woman, very\\r\\nstout and tall, with a foreign face and bare arms. She was sitting near\\r\\nthe piano, laying out a game of patience on her lap. She took no notice\\r\\nwhatever of the visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are the other young ladies?” asked the medical student.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are having their tea,” said the fair girl. “Stepan,” she called,\\r\\n“go and tell the young ladies some students have come!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA little later a third young lady came into the room. She was wearing\\r\\na bright red dress with blue stripes. Her face was painted thickly\\r\\nand unskillfully, her brow was hidden under her hair, and there was an\\r\\nunblinking, frightened stare in her eyes. As she came in, she began\\r\\nat once singing some song in a coarse, powerful contralto. After her a\\r\\nfourth appeared, and after her a fifth....\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all this Vassilyev saw nothing new or interesting. It seemed to him\\r\\nthat that room, the piano, the looking-glass in its cheap gilt frame,\\r\\nthe bunch of white ribbon, the dress with the blue stripes, and the\\r\\nblank indifferent faces, he had seen before and more than once. Of the\\r\\ndarkness, the silence, the secrecy, the guilty smile, of all that he had\\r\\nexpected to meet here and had dreaded, he saw no trace.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was ordinary, prosaic, and uninteresting. Only one thing\\r\\nfaintly stirred his curiosity--the terrible, as it were intentionally\\r\\ndesigned, bad taste which was visible in the cornices, in the absurd\\r\\npictures, in the dresses, in the bunch of ribbons. There was something\\r\\ncharacteristic and peculiar in this bad taste.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How poor and stupid it all is!” thought Vassilyev. “What is there in\\r\\nall this trumpery I see now that can tempt a normal man and excite\\r\\nhim to commit the horrible sin of buying a human being for a rouble?\\r\\nI understand any sin for the sake of splendor, beauty, grace, passion,\\r\\ntaste; but what is there here? What is there here worth sinning for?\\r\\nBut... one mustn’t think!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beardy, treat me to some porter!” said the fair girl, addressing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev was at once overcome with confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“With pleasure,” he said, bowing politely. “Only excuse me, madam,\\r\\nI.... I won’t drink with you. I don’t drink.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later the friends went off into another house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you ask for porter?” said the medical student angrily. “What\\r\\na millionaire! You have thrown away six roubles for no reason\\r\\nwhatever--simply waste!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If she wants it, why not let her have the pleasure?” said Vassilyev,\\r\\njustifying himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not give pleasure to her, but to the ‘Madam.’ They are told\\r\\nto ask the visitors to stand them treat because it is a profit to the\\r\\nkeeper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behold the mill...” hummed the artist, “in ruins now....”\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing into the next house, the friends stopped in the hall and did not\\r\\ngo into the drawing-room. Here, as in the first house, a figure in a\\r\\nblack coat, with a sleepy face like a flunkey’s, got up from a sofa\\r\\nin the hall. Looking at this flunkey, at his face and his shabby black\\r\\ncoat, Vassilyev thought: “What must an ordinary simple Russian have gone\\r\\nthrough before fate flung him down as a flunkey here? Where had he been\\r\\nbefore and what had he done? What was awaiting him? Was he married?\\r\\nWhere was his mother, and did she know that he was a servant here?”\\r\\n And Vassilyev could not help particularly noticing the flunkey in each\\r\\nhouse. In one of the houses--he thought it was the fourth--there was a\\r\\nlittle spare, frail-looking flunkey with a watch-chain on his waistcoat.\\r\\nHe was reading a newspaper, and took no notice of them when they went\\r\\nin. Looking at his face Vassilyev, for some reason, thought that a man\\r\\nwith such a face might steal, might murder, might bear false witness.\\r\\nBut the face was really interesting: a big forehead, gray eyes, a little\\r\\nflattened nose, thin compressed lips, and a blankly stupid and at the\\r\\nsame time insolent expression like that of a young harrier overtaking\\r\\na hare. Vassilyev thought it would be nice to touch this man’s hair, to\\r\\nsee whether it was soft or coarse. It must be coarse like a dog’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving drunk two glasses of porter, the artist became suddenly tipsy and\\r\\ngrew unnaturally lively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go to another!” he said peremptorily, waving his hands. “I will\\r\\ntake you to the best one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had brought his friends to the house which in his opinion was\\r\\nthe best, he declared his firm intention of dancing a quadrille.\\r\\nThe medical student grumbled something about their having to pay\\r\\nthe musicians a rouble, but agreed to be his _vis-a-vis_. They began\\r\\ndancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just as nasty in the best house as in the worst. Here there were\\r\\njust the same looking-glasses and pictures, the same styles of coiffure\\r\\nand dress. Looking round at the furnishing of the rooms and the\\r\\ncostumes, Vassilyev realized that this was not lack of taste, but\\r\\nsomething that might be called the taste, and even the style, of S.\\r\\nStreet, which could not be found elsewhere--something intentional in its\\r\\nugliness, not accidental, but elaborated in the course of years. After\\r\\nhe had been in eight houses he was no longer surprised at the color of\\r\\nthe dresses, at the long trains, the gaudy ribbons, the sailor dresses,\\r\\nand the thick purplish rouge on the cheeks; he saw that it all had to\\r\\nbe like this, that if a single one of the women had been dressed like a\\r\\nhuman being, or if there had been one decent engraving on the wall, the\\r\\ngeneral tone of the whole street would have suffered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How unskillfully they sell themselves!” he thought. “How can they\\r\\nfail to understand that vice is only alluring when it is beautiful and\\r\\nhidden, when it wears the mask of virtue? Modest black dresses, pale\\r\\nfaces, mournful smiles, and darkness would be far more effective than\\r\\nthis clumsy tawdriness. Stupid things! If they don’t understand it of\\r\\nthemselves, their visitors might surely have taught them....”\\r\\n\\r\\nA young lady in a Polish dress edged with white fur came up to him and\\r\\nsat down beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You nice dark man, why aren’t you dancing?” she asked. “Why are you so\\r\\ndull?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it is dull.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Treat me to some Lafitte. Then it won’t be dull.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev made no answer. He was silent for a little, and then asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time do you get to sleep?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At six o’clock.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what time do you get up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes at two and sometimes at three.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what do you do when you get up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have coffee, and at six o’clock we have dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what do you have for dinner?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Usually soup, beefsteak, and dessert. Our madam keeps the girls well.\\r\\nBut why do you ask all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, just to talk....”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev longed to talk to the young lady about many things. He felt an\\r\\nintense desire to find out where she came from, whether her parents were\\r\\nliving, and whether they knew that she was here; how she had come\\r\\ninto this house; whether she were cheerful and satisfied, or sad and\\r\\noppressed by gloomy thoughts; whether she hoped some day to get out of\\r\\nher present position.... But he could not think how to begin or\\r\\nin what shape to put his questions so as not to seem impertinent. He\\r\\nthought for a long time, and asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“How old are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eighty,” the young lady jested, looking with a laugh at the antics of\\r\\nthe artist as he danced.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once she burst out laughing at something, and uttered a long\\r\\ncynical sentence loud enough to be heard by everyone. Vassilyev was\\r\\naghast, and not knowing how to look, gave a constrained smile. He was\\r\\nthe only one who smiled; all the others, his friends, the musicians, the\\r\\nwomen, did not even glance towards his neighbor, but seemed not to have\\r\\nheard her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand me some Lafitte,” his neighbor said again.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev felt a repulsion for her white fur and for her voice, and\\r\\nwalked away from her. It seemed to him hot and stifling, and his heart\\r\\nbegan throbbing slowly but violently, like a hammer--one! two! three!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us go away!” he said, pulling the artist by his sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a little; let me finish.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the artist and the medical student were finishing the quadrille,\\r\\nto avoid looking at the women, Vassilyev scrutinized the musicians. A\\r\\nrespectable-looking old man in spectacles, rather like Marshal Bazaine,\\r\\nwas playing the piano; a young man with a fair beard, dressed in the\\r\\nlatest fashion, was playing the violin. The young man had a face that\\r\\ndid not look stupid nor exhausted, but intelligent, youthful, and fresh.\\r\\nHe was dressed fancifully and with taste; he played with feeling. It was\\r\\na mystery how he and the respectable-looking old man had come here. How\\r\\nwas it they were not ashamed to sit here? What were they thinking about\\r\\nwhen they looked at the women?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the violin and the piano had been played by men in rags, looking\\r\\nhungry, gloomy, drunken, with dissipated or stupid faces, then one could\\r\\nhave understood their presence, perhaps. As it was, Vassilyev could not\\r\\nunderstand it at all. He recalled the story of the fallen woman he had\\r\\nonce read, and he thought now that that human figure with the guilty\\r\\nsmile had nothing in common with what he was seeing now. It seemed to\\r\\nhim that he was seeing not fallen women, but some different world quite\\r\\napart, alien to him and incomprehensible; if he had seen this world\\r\\nbefore on the stage, or read of it in a book, he would not have believed\\r\\nin it....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman with the white fur burst out laughing again and uttered a\\r\\nloathsome sentence in a loud voice. A feeling of disgust took possession\\r\\nof him. He flushed crimson and went out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a minute, we are coming too!” the artist shouted to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\n“While we were dancing,” said the medical student, as they all three\\r\\nwent out into the street, “I had a conversation with my partner. We\\r\\ntalked about her first romance. He, the hero, was an accountant at\\r\\nSmolensk with a wife and five children. She was seventeen, and she lived\\r\\nwith her papa and mamma, who sold soap and candles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did he win her heart?” asked Vassilyev.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By spending fifty roubles on underclothes for her. What next!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So he knew how to get his partner’s story out of her,” thought\\r\\nVassilyev about the medical student. “But I don’t know how to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, I am going home!” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I don’t know how to behave here. Besides, I am bored,\\r\\ndisgusted. What is there amusing in it? If they were human beings--but\\r\\nthey are savages and animals. I am going; do as you like.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Grisha, Grigory, darling...” said the artist in a tearful\\r\\nvoice, hugging Vassilyev, “come along! Let’s go to one more together and\\r\\ndamnation take them!... Please do, Grisha!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey persuaded Vassilyev and led him up a staircase. In the carpet and\\r\\nthe gilt banisters, in the porter who opened the door, and in the panels\\r\\nthat decorated the hall, the same S. Street style was apparent, but\\r\\ncarried to a greater perfection, more imposing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really will go home!” said Vassilyev as he was taking off his coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, dear boy,” said the artist, and he kissed him on the neck.\\r\\n“Don’t be tiresome.... Gri-gri, be a good comrade! We came together,\\r\\nwe will go back together. What a beast you are, really!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can wait for you in the street. I think it’s loathsome, really!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, Grisha.... If it is loathsome, you can observe it! Do\\r\\nyou understand? You can observe!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One must take an objective view of things,” said the medical student\\r\\ngravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev went into the drawing-room and sat down. There were a number\\r\\nof visitors in the room besides him and his friends: two infantry\\r\\nofficers, a bald, gray-haired gentleman in spectacles, two beardless\\r\\nyouths from the institute of land-surveying, and a very tipsy man who\\r\\nlooked like an actor. All the young ladies were taken up with these\\r\\nvisitors and paid no attention to Vassilyev.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one of them, dressed _a la Aida,_ glanced sideways at him, smiled,\\r\\nand said, yawning: “A dark one has come....”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev’s heart was throbbing and his face burned. He felt ashamed\\r\\nbefore these visitors of his presence here, and he felt disgusted and\\r\\nmiserable. He was tormented by the thought that he, a decent and loving\\r\\nman (such as he had hitherto considered himself), hated these women and\\r\\nfelt nothing but repulsion towards them. He felt pity neither for the\\r\\nwomen nor the musicians nor the flunkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is because I am not trying to understand them,” he thought. “They\\r\\nare all more like animals than human beings, but of course they are\\r\\nhuman beings all the same, they have souls. One must understand them\\r\\nand then judge....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grisha, don’t go, wait for us,” the artist shouted to him and\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical student disappeared soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, one must make an effort to understand, one mustn’t be like\\r\\nthis....” Vassilyev went on thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he began gazing at each of the women with strained attention,\\r\\nlooking for a guilty smile. But either he did not know how to read their\\r\\nfaces, or not one of these women felt herself to be guilty; he read on\\r\\nevery face nothing but a blank expression of everyday vulgar boredom and\\r\\ncomplacency. Stupid faces, stupid smiles, harsh, stupid voices, insolent\\r\\nmovements, and nothing else. Apparently each of them had in the past a\\r\\nromance with an accountant based on underclothes for fifty roubles, and\\r\\nlooked for no other charm in the present but coffee, a dinner of three\\r\\ncourses, wines, quadrilles, sleeping till two in the afternoon....\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding no guilty smile, Vassilyev began to look whether there was not\\r\\none intelligent face. And his attention was caught by one pale, rather\\r\\nsleepy, exhausted-looking face.... It was a dark woman, not very\\r\\nyoung, wearing a dress covered with spangles; she was sitting in an\\r\\neasy-chair, looking at the floor lost in thought. Vassilyev walked from\\r\\none corner of the room to the other, and, as though casually, sat down\\r\\nbeside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must begin with something trivial,” he thought, “and pass to what is\\r\\nserious....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a pretty dress you have,” and with his finger he touched the gold\\r\\nfringe of her fichu.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, is it?...” said the dark woman listlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What province do you come from?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I? From a distance.... From Tchernigov.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine province. It’s nice there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Any place seems nice when one is not in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a pity I cannot describe nature,” thought Vassilyev. “I might\\r\\ntouch her by a description of nature in Tchernigov. No doubt she loves\\r\\nthe place if she has been born there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you dull here?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course I am dull.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you go away from here if you are dull?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where should I go to? Go begging or what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Begging would be easier than living here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know that? Have you begged?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, when I hadn’t the money to study. Even if I hadn’t anyone could\\r\\nunderstand that. A beggar is anyway a free man, and you are a slave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark woman stretched, and watched with sleepy eyes the footman who\\r\\nwas bringing a trayful of glasses and seltzer water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand me a glass of porter,” she said, and yawned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Porter,” thought Vassilyev. “And what if your brother or mother walked\\r\\nin at this moment? What would you say? And what would they say? There\\r\\nwould be porter then, I imagine....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once there was the sound of weeping. From the adjoining room,\\r\\nfrom which the footman had brought the seltzer water, a fair man with\\r\\na red face and angry eyes ran in quickly. He was followed by the tall,\\r\\nstout “madam,” who was shouting in a shrill voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody has given you leave to slap girls on the cheeks! We have\\r\\nvisitors better than you, and they don’t fight! Impostor!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA hubbub arose. Vassilyev was frightened and turned pale. In the next\\r\\nroom there was the sound of bitter, genuine weeping, as though of\\r\\nsomeone insulted. And he realized that there were real people living\\r\\nhere who, like people everywhere else, felt insulted, suffered, wept,\\r\\nand cried for help. The feeling of oppressive hate and disgust gave way\\r\\nto an acute feeling of pity and anger against the aggressor. He rushed\\r\\ninto the room where there was weeping. Across rows of bottles on a\\r\\nmarble-top table he distinguished a suffering face, wet with tears,\\r\\nstretched out his hands towards that face, took a step towards the\\r\\ntable, but at once drew back in horror. The weeping girl was drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he made his way though the noisy crowd gathered about the fair man,\\r\\nhis heart sank and he felt frightened like a child; and it seemed to him\\r\\nthat in this alien, incomprehensible world people wanted to pursue him,\\r\\nto beat him, to pelt him with filthy words.... He tore down his coat\\r\\nfrom the hatstand and ran headlong downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning against the fence, he stood near the house waiting for his\\r\\nfriends to come out. The sounds of the pianos and violins, gay,\\r\\nreckless, insolent, and mournful, mingled in the air in a sort of chaos,\\r\\nand this tangle of sounds seemed again like an unseen orchestra tuning\\r\\nup on the roofs. If one looked upwards into the darkness, the black\\r\\nbackground was all spangled with white, moving spots: it was snow\\r\\nfalling. As the snowflakes came into the light they floated round lazily\\r\\nin the air like down, and still more lazily fell to the ground. The\\r\\nsnowflakes whirled thickly round Vassilyev and hung upon his beard,\\r\\nhis eyelashes, his eyebrows.... The cabmen, the horses, and the\\r\\npassers-by were white.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how can the snow fall in this street!” thought Vassilyev.\\r\\n“Damnation take these houses!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis legs seemed to be giving way from fatigue, simply from having run\\r\\ndown the stairs; he gasped for breath as though he had been climbing\\r\\nuphill, his heart beat so loudly that he could hear it. He was consumed\\r\\nby a desire to get out of the street as quickly as possible and to go\\r\\nhome, but even stronger was his desire to wait for his companions and\\r\\nvent upon them his oppressive feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much he did not understand in these houses, the souls of\\r\\nruined women were a mystery to him as before; but it was clear to him\\r\\nthat the thing was far worse than could have been believed. If that\\r\\nsinful woman who had poisoned herself was called fallen, it was\\r\\ndifficult to find a fitting name for all these who were dancing now to\\r\\nthis tangle of sound and uttering long, loathsome sentences. They were\\r\\nnot on the road to ruin, but ruined.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is vice,” he thought, “but neither consciousness of sin nor\\r\\nhope of salvation. They are sold and bought, steeped in wine and\\r\\nabominations, while they, like sheep, are stupid, indifferent, and don’t\\r\\nunderstand. My God! My God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clear to him, too, that everything that is called human dignity,\\r\\npersonal rights, the Divine image and semblance, were defiled to their\\r\\nvery foundations--“to the very marrow,” as drunkards say--and that not\\r\\nonly the street and the stupid women were responsible for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of students, white with snow, passed him laughing and talking\\r\\ngaily; one, a tall thin fellow, stopped, glanced into Vassilyev’s face,\\r\\nand said in a drunken voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of us! A bit on, old man? Aha-ha! Never mind, have a good time!\\r\\nDon’t be down-hearted, old chap!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took Vassilyev by the shoulder and pressed his cold wet mustache\\r\\nagainst his cheek, then he slipped, staggered, and, waving both hands,\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold on! Don’t upset!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd laughing, he ran to overtake his companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the noise came the sound of the artist’s voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you dare to hit the women! I won’t let you, damnation take you!\\r\\nYou scoundrels!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical student appeared in the doorway. He looked from side to\\r\\nside, and seeing Vassilyev, said in an agitated voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You here! I tell you it’s really impossible to go anywhere with Yegor!\\r\\nWhat a fellow he is! I don’t understand him! He has got up a scene! Do\\r\\nyou hear? Yegor!” he shouted at the door. “Yegor!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t allow you to hit women!” the artist’s piercing voice sounded\\r\\nfrom above. Something heavy and lumbering rolled down the stairs. It was\\r\\nthe artist falling headlong. Evidently he had been pushed downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked himself up from the ground, shook his hat, and, with an angry\\r\\nand indignant face, brandished his fist towards the top of the stairs\\r\\nand shouted:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Scoundrels! Torturers! Bloodsuckers! I won’t allow you to hit them! To\\r\\nhit a weak, drunken woman! Oh, you brutes!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yegor!... Come, Yegor!...” the medical student began imploring\\r\\nhim. “I give you my word of honor I’ll never come with you again. On my\\r\\nword of honor I won’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little the artist was pacified and the friends went homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Against my will an unknown force,” hummed the medical student, “has led\\r\\nme to these mournful shores.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behold the mill,” the artist chimed in a little later, “in ruins now.\\r\\nWhat a lot of snow, Holy Mother! Grisha, why did you go? You are a funk,\\r\\na regular old woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev walked behind his companions, looked at their backs, and\\r\\nthought:\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of two things: either we only fancy prostitution is an evil, and\\r\\nwe exaggerate it; or, if prostitution really is as great an evil as is\\r\\ngenerally assumed, these dear friends of mine are as much slaveowners,\\r\\nviolators, and murderers, as the inhabitants of Syria and Cairo, that\\r\\nare described in the ‘Neva.’ Now they are singing, laughing, talking\\r\\nsense, but haven’t they just been exploiting hunger, ignorance, and\\r\\nstupidity? They have--I have been a witness of it. What is the use of\\r\\ntheir humanity, their medicine, their painting? The science, art, and\\r\\nlofty sentiments of these soul-destroyers remind me of the piece of\\r\\nbacon in the story. Two brigands murdered a beggar in a forest; they\\r\\nbegan sharing his clothes between them, and found in his wallet a piece\\r\\nof bacon. ‘Well found,’ said one of them, ‘let us have a bit.’ ‘What do\\r\\nyou mean? How can you?’ cried the other in horror. ‘Have you forgotten\\r\\nthat to-day is Wednesday?’ And they would not eat it. After murdering a\\r\\nman, they came out of the forest in the firm conviction that they were\\r\\nkeeping the fast. In the same way these men, after buying women, go\\r\\ntheir way imagining that they are artists and men of science....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen!” he said sharply and angrily. “Why do you come here? Is it\\r\\npossible--is it possible you don’t understand how horrible it is? Your\\r\\nmedical books tell you that every one of these women dies prematurely of\\r\\nconsumption or something; art tells you that morally they are dead even\\r\\nearlier. Every one of them dies because she has in her time to entertain\\r\\nfive hundred men on an average, let us say. Each one of them is killed\\r\\nby five hundred men. You are among those five hundred! If each of you in\\r\\nthe course of your lives visits this place or others like it two hundred\\r\\nand fifty times, it follows that one woman is killed for every two of\\r\\nyou! Can’t you understand that? Isn’t it horrible to murder, two of you,\\r\\nthree of you, five of you, a foolish, hungry woman! Ah! isn’t it awful,\\r\\nmy God!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew it would end like that,” the artist said frowning. “We ought not\\r\\nto have gone with this fool and ass! You imagine you have grand notions\\r\\nin your head now, ideas, don’t you? No, it’s the devil knows what, but\\r\\nnot ideas. You are looking at me now with hatred and repulsion, but I\\r\\ntell you it’s better you should set up twenty more houses like those\\r\\nthan look like that. There’s more vice in your expression than in the\\r\\nwhole street! Come along, Volodya, let him go to the devil! He’s a fool\\r\\nand an ass, and that’s all....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We human beings do murder each other,” said the medical student. “It’s\\r\\nimmoral, of course, but philosophizing doesn’t help it. Good-by!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Trubnoy Square the friends said good-by and parted. When he was left\\r\\nalone, Vassilyev strode rapidly along the boulevard. He felt frightened\\r\\nof the darkness, of the snow which was falling in heavy flakes on the\\r\\nground, and seemed as though it would cover up the whole world; he\\r\\nfelt frightened of the street lamps shining with pale light through\\r\\nthe clouds of snow. His soul was possessed by an unaccountable,\\r\\nfaint-hearted terror. Passers-by came towards him from time to time,\\r\\nbut he timidly moved to one side; it seemed to him that women, none but\\r\\nwomen, were coming from all sides and staring at him....\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s beginning,” he thought, “I am going to have a breakdown.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVI\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home he lay on his bed and said, shuddering all over: “They are\\r\\nalive! Alive! My God, those women are alive!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe encouraged his imagination in all sorts of ways to picture himself\\r\\nthe brother of a fallen woman, or her father; then a fallen woman\\r\\nherself, with her painted cheeks; and it all moved him to horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to him that he must settle the question at once at all costs,\\r\\nand that this question was not one that did not concern him, but was his\\r\\nown personal problem. He made an immense effort, repressed his despair,\\r\\nand, sitting on the bed, holding his head in his hands, began thinking\\r\\nhow one could save all the women he had seen that day. The method for\\r\\nattacking problems of all kinds was, as he was an educated man, well\\r\\nknown to him. And, however excited he was, he strictly adhered to that\\r\\nmethod. He recalled the history of the problem and its literature, and\\r\\nfor a quarter of an hour he paced from one end of the room to the other\\r\\ntrying to remember all the methods practiced at the present time for\\r\\nsaving women. He had very many good friends and acquaintances who lived\\r\\nin lodgings in Petersburg.... Among them were a good many honest and\\r\\nself-sacrificing men. Some of them had attempted to save women....\\r\\n\\r\\n“All these not very numerous attempts,” thought Vassilyev, “can be\\r\\ndivided into three groups. Some, after buying the woman out of the\\r\\nbrothel, took a room for her, bought her a sewing-machine, and she\\r\\nbecame a semptress. And whether he wanted to or not, after having bought\\r\\nher out he made her his mistress; then when he had taken his degree, he\\r\\nwent away and handed her into the keeping of some other decent man as\\r\\nthough she were a thing. And the fallen woman remained a fallen woman.\\r\\nOthers, after buying her out, took a lodging apart for her, bought the\\r\\ninevitable sewing-machine, and tried teaching her to read, preaching at\\r\\nher and giving her books. The woman lived and sewed as long as it was\\r\\ninteresting and a novelty to her, then getting bored, began receiving\\r\\nmen on the sly, or ran away and went back where she could sleep till\\r\\nthree o’clock, drink coffee, and have good dinners. The third class, the\\r\\nmost ardent and self-sacrificing, had taken a bold, resolute step.\\r\\nThey had married them. And when the insolent and spoilt, or stupid and\\r\\ncrushed animal became a wife, the head of a household, and afterwards a\\r\\nmother, it turned her whole existence and attitude to life upside down,\\r\\nso that it was hard to recognize the fallen woman afterwards in the wife\\r\\nand the mother. Yes, marriage was the best and perhaps the only means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is impossible!” Vassilyev said aloud, and he sank upon his bed.\\r\\n“I, to begin with, could not marry one! To do that one must be a saint\\r\\nand be unable to feel hatred or repulsion. But supposing that I,\\r\\nthe medical student, and the artist mastered ourselves and did marry\\r\\nthem--suppose they were all married. What would be the result? The\\r\\nresult would be that while here in Moscow they were being married, some\\r\\nSmolensk accountant would be debauching another lot, and that lot would\\r\\nbe streaming here to fill the vacant places, together with others from\\r\\nSaratov, Nizhni-Novgorod, Warsaw.... And what is one to do with the\\r\\nhundred thousand in London? What’s one to do with those in Hamburg?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lamp in which the oil had burnt down began to smoke. Vassilyev did\\r\\nnot notice it. He began pacing to and fro again, still thinking. Now he\\r\\nput the question differently: what must be done that fallen women should\\r\\nnot be needed? For that, it was essential that the men who buy them\\r\\nand do them to death should feel all the immorality of their share in\\r\\nenslaving them and should be horrified. One must save the men.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One won’t do anything by art and science, that is clear...” thought\\r\\nVassilyev. “The only way out of it is missionary work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he began to dream how he would the next evening stand at the corner\\r\\nof the street and say to every passer-by: “Where are you going and what\\r\\nfor? Have some fear of God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would turn to the apathetic cabmen and say to them: “Why are you\\r\\nstaying here? Why aren’t you revolted? Why aren’t you indignant? I\\r\\nsuppose you believe in God and know that it is a sin, that people go to\\r\\nhell for it? Why don’t you speak? It is true that they are strangers\\r\\nto you, but you know even they have fathers, brothers like\\r\\nyourselves....”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Vassilyev’s friends had once said of him that he was a talented\\r\\nman. There are all sorts of talents--talent for writing, talent for\\r\\nthe stage, talent for art; but he had a peculiar talent--a talent for\\r\\n_humanity_. He possessed an extraordinarily fine delicate scent for pain\\r\\nin general. As a good actor reflects in himself the movements and voice\\r\\nof others, so Vassilyev could reflect in his soul the sufferings of\\r\\nothers. When he saw tears, he wept; beside a sick man, he felt sick\\r\\nhimself and moaned; if he saw an act of violence, he felt as though he\\r\\nhimself were the victim of it, he was frightened as a child, and in his\\r\\nfright ran to help. The pain of others worked on his nerves, excited\\r\\nhim, roused him to a state of frenzy, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether this friend were right I don’t know, but what Vassilyev\\r\\nexperienced when he thought this question was settled was something like\\r\\ninspiration. He cried and laughed, spoke aloud the words that he should\\r\\nsay next day, felt a fervent love for those who would listen to him and\\r\\nwould stand beside him at the corner of the street to preach; he sat\\r\\ndown to write letters, made vows to himself....\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was like inspiration also from the fact that it did not last\\r\\nlong. Vassilyev was soon tired. The cases in London, in Hamburg, in\\r\\nWarsaw, weighed upon him by their mass as a mountain weighs upon the\\r\\nearth; he felt dispirited, bewildered, in the face of this mass; he\\r\\nremembered that he had not a gift for words, that he was cowardly\\r\\nand timid, that indifferent people would not be willing to listen\\r\\nand understand him, a law student in his third year, a timid and\\r\\ninsignificant person; that genuine missionary work included not only\\r\\nteaching but deeds...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight and carriages were already beginning to rumble in\\r\\nthe street, Vassilyev was lying motionless on the sofa, staring into\\r\\nspace. He was no longer thinking of the women, nor of the men, nor of\\r\\nmissionary work. His whole attention was turned upon the spiritual agony\\r\\nwhich was torturing him. It was a dull, vague, undefined anguish akin to\\r\\nmisery, to an extreme form of terror and to despair. He could point\\r\\nto the place where the pain was, in his breast under his heart; but\\r\\nhe could not compare it with anything. In the past he had had acute\\r\\ntoothache, he had had pleurisy and neuralgia, but all that was\\r\\ninsignificant compared with this spiritual anguish. In the presence of\\r\\nthat pain life seemed loathsome. The dissertation, the excellent work\\r\\nhe had written already, the people he loved, the salvation of fallen\\r\\nwomen--everything that only the day before he had cared about or been\\r\\nindifferent to, now when he thought of them irritated him in the same\\r\\nway as the noise of the carriages, the scurrying footsteps of the\\r\\nwaiters in the passage, the daylight.... If at that moment someone\\r\\nhad performed a great deed of mercy or had committed a revolting\\r\\noutrage, he would have felt the same repulsion for both actions. Of all\\r\\nthe thoughts that strayed through his mind only two did not irritate\\r\\nhim: one was that at every moment he had the power to kill himself, the\\r\\nother that this agony would not last more than three days. This last he\\r\\nknew by experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter lying for a while he got up and, wringing his hands, walked about\\r\\nthe room, not as usual from corner to corner, but round the room beside\\r\\nthe walls. As he passed he glanced at himself in the looking-glass. His\\r\\nface looked pale and sunken, his temples looked hollow, his eyes were\\r\\nbigger, darker, more staring, as though they belonged to someone else,\\r\\nand they had an expression of insufferable mental agony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midday the artist knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grigory, are you at home?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting no answer, he stood for a minute, pondered, and answered\\r\\nhimself in Little Russian: “Nay. The confounded fellow has gone to the\\r\\nUniversity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went away. Vassilyev lay down on the bed and, thrusting his head\\r\\nunder the pillow, began crying with agony, and the more freely his tears\\r\\nflowed the more terrible his mental anguish became. As it began to get\\r\\ndark, he thought of the agonizing night awaiting him, and was overcome\\r\\nby a horrible despair. He dressed quickly, ran out of his room, and,\\r\\nleaving his door wide open, for no object or reason, went out into the\\r\\nstreet. Without asking himself where he should go, he walked quickly\\r\\nalong Sadovoy Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow was falling as heavily as the day before; it was thawing. Thrusting\\r\\nhis hands into his sleeves, shuddering and frightened at the noises,\\r\\nat the trambells, and at the passers-by, Vassilyev walked along Sadovoy\\r\\nStreet as far as Suharev Tower; then to the Red Gate; from there he\\r\\nturned off to Basmannya Street. He went into a tavern and drank off\\r\\na big glass of vodka, but that did not make him feel better. When he\\r\\nreached Razgulya he turned to the right, and strode along side streets\\r\\nin which he had never been before in his life. He reached the old bridge\\r\\nby which the Yauza runs gurgling, and from which one can see long rows\\r\\nof lights in the windows of the Red Barracks. To distract his spiritual\\r\\nanguish by some new sensation or some other pain, Vassilyev, not knowing\\r\\nwhat to do, crying and shuddering, undid his greatcoat and jacket and\\r\\nexposed his bare chest to the wet snow and the wind. But that did not\\r\\nlessen his suffering either. Then he bent down over the rail of the\\r\\nbridge and looked down into the black, yeasty Yauza, and he longed to\\r\\nplunge down head foremost; not from loathing for life, not for the sake\\r\\nof suicide, but in order to bruise himself at least, and by one pain to\\r\\nease the other. But the black water, the darkness, the deserted banks\\r\\ncovered with snow were terrifying. He shivered and walked on. He walked\\r\\nup and down by the Red Barracks, then turned back and went down to a\\r\\ncopse, from the copse back to the bridge again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, home, home!” he thought. “At home I believe it’s better...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went back. When he reached home he pulled off his wet coat and\\r\\ncap, began pacing round the room, and went on pacing round and round\\r\\nwithout stopping till morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen next morning the artist and the medical student went in to him,\\r\\nhe was moving about the room with his shirt torn, biting his hands and\\r\\nmoaning with pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For God’s sake!” he sobbed when he saw his friends, “take me where you\\r\\nplease, do what you can; but for God’s sake, save me quickly! I shall\\r\\nkill myself!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist turned pale and was helpless. The medical student, too,\\r\\nalmost shed tears, but considering that doctors ought to be cool and\\r\\ncomposed in every emergency said coldly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a nervous breakdown. But it’s nothing. Let us go at once to the\\r\\ndoctor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wherever you like, only for God’s sake, make haste!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t excite yourself. You must try and control yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist and the medical student with trembling hands put Vassilyev’s\\r\\ncoat and hat on and led him out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mihail Sergeyitch has been wanting to make your acquaintance for a long\\r\\ntime,” the medical student said on the way. “He is a very nice man and\\r\\nthoroughly good at his work. He took his degree in 1882, and he has\\r\\nan immense practice already. He treats students as though he were one\\r\\nhimself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Make haste, make haste!...” Vassilyev urged.\\r\\n\\r\\nMihail Sergeyitch, a stout, fair-haired doctor, received the friends\\r\\nwith politeness and frigid dignity, and smiled only on one side of his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rybnikov and Mayer have spoken to me of your illness already,” he said.\\r\\n“Very glad to be of service to you. Well? Sit down, I beg....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made Vassilyev sit down in a big armchair near the table, and moved a\\r\\nbox of cigarettes towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now then!” he began, stroking his knees. “Let us get to work.... How\\r\\nold are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe asked questions and the medical student answered them. He asked\\r\\nwhether Vassilyev’s father had suffered from certain special diseases,\\r\\nwhether he drank to excess, whether he were remarkable for cruelty or\\r\\nany peculiarities. He made similar inquiries about his grandfather,\\r\\nmother, sisters, and brothers. On learning that his mother had a\\r\\nbeautiful voice and sometimes acted on the stage, he grew more animated\\r\\nat once, and asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, but don’t you remember, perhaps, your mother had a passion\\r\\nfor the stage?”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty minutes passed. Vassilyev was annoyed by the way the doctor kept\\r\\nstroking his knees and talking of the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So far as I understand your questions, doctor,” he said, “you want to\\r\\nknow whether my illness is hereditary or not. It is not.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor proceeded to ask Vassilyev whether he had had any secret\\r\\nvices as a boy, or had received injuries to his head; whether he had had\\r\\nany aberrations, any peculiarities, or exceptional propensities. Half\\r\\nthe questions usually asked by doctors of their patients can be left\\r\\nunanswered without the slightest ill effect on the health, but Mihail\\r\\nSergeyitch, the medical student, and the artist all looked as though\\r\\nif Vassilyev failed to answer one question all would be lost. As he\\r\\nreceived answers, the doctor for some reason noted them down on a slip\\r\\nof paper. On learning that Vassilyev had taken his degree in natural\\r\\nscience, and was now studying law, the doctor pondered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He wrote a first-rate piece of original work last year,...” said the\\r\\nmedical student.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon, but don’t interrupt me; you prevent me from\\r\\nconcentrating,” said the doctor, and he smiled on one side of his\\r\\nface. “Though, of course, that does enter into the diagnosis. Intense\\r\\nintellectual work, nervous exhaustion.... Yes, yes.... And do you\\r\\ndrink vodka?” he said, addressing Vassilyev.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very rarely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother twenty minutes passed. The medical student began telling the\\r\\ndoctor in a low voice his opinion as to the immediate cause of\\r\\nthe attack, and described how the day before yesterday the artist,\\r\\nVassilyev, and he had visited S. Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indifferent, reserved, and frigid tone in which his friends and the\\r\\ndoctor spoke of the women and that miserable street struck Vassilyev as\\r\\nstrange in the extreme....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Doctor, tell me one thing only,” he said, controlling himself so as not\\r\\nto speak rudely. “Is prostitution an evil or not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, who disputes it?” said the doctor, with an expression\\r\\nthat suggested that he had settled all such questions for himself long\\r\\nago. “Who disputes it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a mental doctor, aren’t you?” Vassilyev asked curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, a mental doctor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps all of you are right!” said Vassilyev, getting up and beginning\\r\\nto walk from one end of the room to the other. “Perhaps! But it all\\r\\nseems marvelous to me! That I should have taken my degree in two\\r\\nfaculties you look upon as a great achievement; because I have written\\r\\na work which in three years will be thrown aside and forgotten, I am\\r\\npraised up to the skies; but because I cannot speak of fallen women as\\r\\nunconcernedly as of these chairs, I am being examined by a doctor, I am\\r\\ncalled mad, I am pitied!”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassilyev for some reason felt all at once unutterably sorry for\\r\\nhimself, and his companions, and all the people he had seen two days\\r\\nbefore, and for the doctor; he burst into tears and sank into a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis friends looked inquiringly at the doctor. The latter, with the\\r\\nair of completely comprehending the tears and the despair, of feeling\\r\\nhimself a specialist in that line, went up to Vassilyev and, without\\r\\na word, gave him some medicine to drink; and then, when he was calmer,\\r\\nundressed him and began to investigate the degree of sensibility of the\\r\\nskin, the reflex action of the knees, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Vassilyev felt easier. When he came out from the doctor’s he\\r\\nwas beginning to feel ashamed; the rattle of the carriages no longer\\r\\nirritated him, and the load at his heart grew lighter and lighter as\\r\\nthough it were melting away. He had two prescriptions in his hand:\\r\\none was for bromide, one was for morphia.... He had taken all these\\r\\nremedies before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the street he stood still and, saying good-by to his friends, dragged\\r\\nhimself languidly to the University.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMISERY\\r\\n\\r\\n“To whom shall I tell my grief?”\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE twilight of evening. Big flakes of wet snow are whirling lazily\\r\\nabout the street lamps, which have just been lighted, and lying in a\\r\\nthin soft layer on roofs, horses’ backs, shoulders, caps. Iona Potapov,\\r\\nthe sledge-driver, is all white like a ghost. He sits on the box without\\r\\nstirring, bent as double as the living body can be bent. If a regular\\r\\nsnowdrift fell on him it seems as though even then he would not think it\\r\\nnecessary to shake it off.... His little mare is white and motionless\\r\\ntoo. Her stillness, the angularity of her lines, and the stick-like\\r\\nstraightness of her legs make her look like a halfpenny gingerbread\\r\\nhorse. She is probably lost in thought. Anyone who has been torn away\\r\\nfrom the plough, from the familiar gray landscapes, and cast into this\\r\\nslough, full of monstrous lights, of unceasing uproar and hurrying\\r\\npeople, is bound to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a long time since Iona and his nag have budged. They came out of\\r\\nthe yard before dinnertime and not a single fare yet. But now the shades\\r\\nof evening are falling on the town. The pale light of the street lamps\\r\\nchanges to a vivid color, and the bustle of the street grows noisier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sledge to Vyborgskaya!” Iona hears. “Sledge!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona starts, and through his snow-plastered eyelashes sees an officer in\\r\\na military overcoat with a hood over his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Vyborgskaya,” repeats the officer. “Are you asleep? To Vyborgskaya!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn token of assent Iona gives a tug at the reins which sends cakes of\\r\\nsnow flying from the horse’s back and shoulders. The officer gets into\\r\\nthe sledge. The sledge-driver clicks to the horse, cranes his neck like\\r\\na swan, rises in his seat, and more from habit than necessity brandishes\\r\\nhis whip. The mare cranes her neck, too, crooks her stick-like legs, and\\r\\nhesitatingly sets of....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you shoving, you devil?” Iona immediately hears shouts from\\r\\nthe dark mass shifting to and fro before him. “Where the devil are you\\r\\ngoing? Keep to the r-right!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t know how to drive! Keep to the right,” says the officer\\r\\nangrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nA coachman driving a carriage swears at him; a pedestrian crossing\\r\\nthe road and brushing the horse’s nose with his shoulder looks at him\\r\\nangrily and shakes the snow off his sleeve. Iona fidgets on the box as\\r\\nthough he were sitting on thorns, jerks his elbows, and turns his eyes\\r\\nabout like one possessed as though he did not know where he was or why\\r\\nhe was there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What rascals they all are!” says the officer jocosely. “They are simply\\r\\ndoing their best to run up against you or fall under the horse’s feet.\\r\\nThey must be doing it on purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona looks as his fare and moves his lips.... Apparently he means to\\r\\nsay something, but nothing comes but a sniff.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” inquires the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIona gives a wry smile, and straining his throat, brings out huskily:\\r\\n“My son... er... my son died this week, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“H’m! What did he die of?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona turns his whole body round to his fare, and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who can tell! It must have been from fever.... He lay three days in\\r\\nthe hospital and then he died.... God’s will.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Turn round, you devil!” comes out of the darkness. “Have you gone\\r\\ncracked, you old dog? Look where you are going!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Drive on! drive on!...” says the officer. “We shan’t get there till\\r\\nto-morrow going on like this. Hurry up!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sledge-driver cranes his neck again, rises in his seat, and with\\r\\nheavy grace swings his whip. Several times he looks round at the\\r\\nofficer, but the latter keeps his eyes shut and is apparently\\r\\ndisinclined to listen. Putting his fare down at Vyborgskaya, Iona stops\\r\\nby a restaurant, and again sits huddled up on the box.... Again\\r\\nthe wet snow paints him and his horse white. One hour passes, and then\\r\\nanother....\\r\\n\\r\\nThree young men, two tall and thin, one short and hunchbacked, come up,\\r\\nrailing at each other and loudly stamping on the pavement with their\\r\\ngoloshes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cabby, to the Police Bridge!” the hunchback cries in a cracked voice.\\r\\n“The three of us,... twenty kopecks!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona tugs at the reins and clicks to his horse. Twenty kopecks is not a\\r\\nfair price, but he has no thoughts for that. Whether it is a rouble or\\r\\nwhether it is five kopecks does not matter to him now so long as he\\r\\nhas a fare.... The three young men, shoving each other and using bad\\r\\nlanguage, go up to the sledge, and all three try to sit down at once.\\r\\nThe question remains to be settled: Which are to sit down and which one\\r\\nis to stand? After a long altercation, ill-temper, and abuse, they\\r\\ncome to the conclusion that the hunchback must stand because he is the\\r\\nshortest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, drive on,” says the hunchback in his cracked voice, settling\\r\\nhimself and breathing down Iona’s neck. “Cut along! What a cap you’ve\\r\\ngot, my friend! You wouldn’t find a worse one in all Petersburg....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he!... he-he!...” laughs Iona. “It’s nothing to boast of!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, nothing to boast of, drive on! Are you going to drive like\\r\\nthis all the way? Eh? Shall I give you one in the neck?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My head aches,” says one of the tall ones. “At the Dukmasovs’ yesterday\\r\\nVaska and I drank four bottles of brandy between us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t make out why you talk such stuff,” says the other tall one\\r\\nangrily. “You lie like a brute.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Strike me dead, it’s the truth!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s about as true as that a louse coughs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he!” grins Iona. “Me-er-ry gentlemen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tfoo! the devil take you!” cries the hunchback indignantly. “Will you\\r\\nget on, you old plague, or won’t you? Is that the way to drive? Give her\\r\\none with the whip. Hang it all, give it her well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona feels behind his back the jolting person and quivering voice of\\r\\nthe hunchback. He hears abuse addressed to him, he sees people, and the\\r\\nfeeling of loneliness begins little by little to be less heavy on his\\r\\nheart. The hunchback swears at him, till he chokes over some elaborately\\r\\nwhimsical string of epithets and is overpowered by his cough. His tall\\r\\ncompanions begin talking of a certain Nadyezhda Petrovna. Iona looks\\r\\nround at them. Waiting till there is a brief pause, he looks round once\\r\\nmore and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“This week... er... my... er... son died!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall all die,...” says the hunchback with a sigh, wiping his\\r\\nlips after coughing. “Come, drive on! drive on! My friends, I simply\\r\\ncannot stand crawling like this! When will he get us there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you give him a little encouragement... one in the neck!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you hear, you old plague? I’ll make you smart. If one stands on\\r\\nceremony with fellows like you one may as well walk. Do you hear, you\\r\\nold dragon? Or don’t you care a hang what we say?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iona hears rather than feels a slap on the back of his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He-he!...” he laughs. “Merry gentlemen.... God give you\\r\\nhealth!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cabman, are you married?” asks one of the tall ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I? He he! Me-er-ry gentlemen. The only wife for me now is the damp\\r\\nearth.... He-ho-ho!.... The grave that is!... Here my son’s dead\\r\\nand I am alive.... It’s a strange thing, death has come in at the\\r\\nwrong door.... Instead of coming for me it went for my son....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Iona turns round to tell them how his son died, but at that point\\r\\nthe hunchback gives a faint sigh and announces that, thank God! they\\r\\nhave arrived at last. After taking his twenty kopecks, Iona gazes for a\\r\\nlong while after the revelers, who disappear into a dark entry. Again he\\r\\nis alone and again there is silence for him.... The misery which has\\r\\nbeen for a brief space eased comes back again and tears his heart more\\r\\ncruelly than ever. With a look of anxiety and suffering Iona’s eyes\\r\\nstray restlessly among the crowds moving to and fro on both sides of the\\r\\nstreet: can he not find among those thousands someone who will listen\\r\\nto him? But the crowds flit by heedless of him and his misery.... His\\r\\nmisery is immense, beyond all bounds. If Iona’s heart were to burst and\\r\\nhis misery to flow out, it would flood the whole world, it seems, but\\r\\nyet it is not seen. It has found a hiding-place in such an insignificant\\r\\nshell that one would not have found it with a candle by daylight....\\r\\n\\r\\nIona sees a house-porter with a parcel and makes up his mind to address\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time will it be, friend?” he asks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Going on for ten.... Why have you stopped here? Drive on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona drives a few paces away, bends himself double, and gives himself\\r\\nup to his misery. He feels it is no good to appeal to people. But before\\r\\nfive minutes have passed he draws himself up, shakes his head as though\\r\\nhe feels a sharp pain, and tugs at the reins.... He can bear it no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Back to the yard!” he thinks. “To the yard!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd his little mare, as though she knew his thoughts, falls to trotting.\\r\\nAn hour and a half later Iona is sitting by a big dirty stove. On the\\r\\nstove, on the floor, and on the benches are people snoring. The air\\r\\nis full of smells and stuffiness. Iona looks at the sleeping figures,\\r\\nscratches himself, and regrets that he has come home so early....\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not earned enough to pay for the oats, even,” he thinks. “That’s\\r\\nwhy I am so miserable. A man who knows how to do his work,... who has\\r\\nhad enough to eat, and whose horse has had enough to eat, is always at\\r\\nease....”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of the corners a young cabman gets up, clears his throat\\r\\nsleepily, and makes for the water-bucket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Want a drink?” Iona asks him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seems so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“May it do you good.... But my son is dead, mate.... Do you hear?\\r\\nThis week in the hospital.... It’s a queer business....”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona looks to see the effect produced by his words, but he sees nothing.\\r\\nThe young man has covered his head over and is already asleep. The old\\r\\nman sighs and scratches himself.... Just as the young man had been\\r\\nthirsty for water, he thirsts for speech. His son will soon have been\\r\\ndead a week, and he has not really talked to anybody yet.... He\\r\\nwants to talk of it properly, with deliberation.... He wants to tell\\r\\nhow his son was taken ill, how he suffered, what he said before he died,\\r\\nhow he died.... He wants to describe the funeral, and how he went to\\r\\nthe hospital to get his son’s clothes. He still has his daughter Anisya\\r\\nin the country.... And he wants to talk about her too.... Yes, he\\r\\nhas plenty to talk about now. His listener ought to sigh and exclaim and\\r\\nlament.... It would be even better to talk to women. Though they are\\r\\nsilly creatures, they blubber at the first word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go out and have a look at the mare,” Iona thinks. “There is\\r\\nalways time for sleep.... You’ll have sleep enough, no fear....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe puts on his coat and goes into the stables where his mare is\\r\\nstanding. He thinks about oats, about hay, about the weather.... He\\r\\ncannot think about his son when he is alone.... To talk about\\r\\nhim with someone is possible, but to think of him and picture him is\\r\\ninsufferable anguish....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you munching?” Iona asks his mare, seeing her shining eyes. “There,\\r\\nmunch away, munch away.... Since we have not earned enough for oats,\\r\\nwe will eat hay.... Yes,... I have grown too old to drive....\\r\\nMy son ought to be driving, not I.... He was a real cabman.... He\\r\\nought to have lived....”\\r\\n\\r\\nIona is silent for a while, and then he goes on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s how it is, old girl.... Kuzma Ionitch is gone.... He said\\r\\ngood-by to me.... He went and died for no reason.... Now, suppose\\r\\nyou had a little colt, and you were own mother to that little colt.\\r\\n... And all at once that same little colt went and died.... You’d\\r\\nbe sorry, wouldn’t you?...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little mare munches, listens, and breathes on her master’s hands.\\r\\nIona is carried away and tells her all about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAMPAGNE\\r\\n\\r\\nA WAYFARER’S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the year in which my story begins I had a job at a little station on\\r\\none of our southwestern railways. Whether I had a gay or a dull life\\r\\nat the station you can judge from the fact that for fifteen miles\\r\\nround there was not one human habitation, not one woman, not one decent\\r\\ntavern; and in those days I was young, strong, hot-headed, giddy, and\\r\\nfoolish. The only distraction I could possibly find was in the windows\\r\\nof the passenger trains, and in the vile vodka which the Jews drugged\\r\\nwith thorn-apple. Sometimes there would be a glimpse of a woman’s\\r\\nhead at a carriage window, and one would stand like a statue without\\r\\nbreathing and stare at it until the train turned into an almost\\r\\ninvisible speck; or one would drink all one could of the loathsome vodka\\r\\ntill one was stupefied and did not feel the passing of the long hours\\r\\nand days. Upon me, a native of the north, the steppe produced the\\r\\neffect of a deserted Tatar cemetery. In the summer the steppe with its\\r\\nsolemn calm, the monotonous chur of the grasshoppers, the transparent\\r\\nmoonlight from which one could not hide, reduced me to listless\\r\\nmelancholy; and in the winter the irreproachable whiteness of the\\r\\nsteppe, its cold distance, long nights, and howling wolves oppressed me\\r\\nlike a heavy nightmare. There were several people living at the\\r\\nstation: my wife and I, a deaf and scrofulous telegraph clerk, and three\\r\\nwatchmen. My assistant, a young man who was in consumption, used to go\\r\\nfor treatment to the town, where he stayed for months at a time, leaving\\r\\nhis duties to me together with the right of pocketing his salary. I had\\r\\nno children, no cake would have tempted visitors to come and see me, and\\r\\nI could only visit other officials on the line, and that no oftener than\\r\\nonce a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember my wife and I saw the New Year in. We sat at table, chewed\\r\\nlazily, and heard the deaf telegraph clerk monotonously tapping on his\\r\\napparatus in the next room. I had already drunk five glasses of\\r\\ndrugged vodka, and, propping my heavy head on my fist, thought of my\\r\\noverpowering boredom from which there was no escape, while my wife sat\\r\\nbeside me and did not take her eyes off me. She looked at me as no\\r\\none can look but a woman who has nothing in this world but a handsome\\r\\nhusband. She loved me madly, slavishly, and not merely my good looks,\\r\\nor my soul, but my sins, my ill-humor and boredom, and even my cruelty\\r\\nwhen, in drunken fury, not knowing how to vent my ill-humor, I tormented\\r\\nher with reproaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the boredom which was consuming me, we were preparing to see\\r\\nthe New Year in with exceptional festiveness, and were awaiting midnight\\r\\nwith some impatience. The fact is, we had in reserve two bottles of\\r\\nchampagne, the real thing, with the label of Veuve Clicquot; this\\r\\ntreasure I had won the previous autumn in a bet with the station-master\\r\\nof D. when I was drinking with him at a christening. It sometimes\\r\\nhappens during a lesson in mathematics, when the very air is still with\\r\\nboredom, a butterfly flutters into the class-room; the boys toss their\\r\\nheads and begin watching its flight with interest, as though they saw\\r\\nbefore them not a butterfly but something new and strange; in the same\\r\\nway ordinary champagne, chancing to come into our dreary station,\\r\\nroused us. We sat in silence looking alternately at the clock and at the\\r\\nbottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hands pointed to five minutes to twelve I slowly began\\r\\nuncorking a bottle. I don’t know whether I was affected by the vodka,\\r\\nor whether the bottle was wet, but all I remember is that when the cork\\r\\nflew up to the ceiling with a bang, my bottle slipped out of my hands\\r\\nand fell on the floor. Not more than a glass of the wine was spilt, as I\\r\\nmanaged to catch the bottle and put my thumb over the foaming neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, may the New Year bring you happiness!” I said, filling two\\r\\nglasses. “Drink!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife took her glass and fixed her frightened eyes on me. Her face was\\r\\npale and wore a look of horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you drop the bottle?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. But what of that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s unlucky,” she said, putting down her glass and turning paler\\r\\nstill. “It’s a bad omen. It means that some misfortune will happen to us\\r\\nthis year.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a silly thing you are,” I sighed. “You are a clever woman, and yet\\r\\nyou talk as much nonsense as an old nurse. Drink.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God grant it is nonsense, but... something is sure to happen! You’ll\\r\\nsee.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not even sip her glass, she moved away and sank into thought.\\r\\nI uttered a few stale commonplaces about superstition, drank half a\\r\\nbottle, paced up and down, and then went out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside there was the still frosty night in all its cold, inhospitable\\r\\nbeauty. The moon and two white fluffy clouds beside it hung just over\\r\\nthe station, motionless as though glued to the spot, and looked as\\r\\nthough waiting for something. A faint transparent light came from them\\r\\nand touched the white earth softly, as though afraid of wounding\\r\\nher modesty, and lighted up everything--the snowdrifts, the\\r\\nembankment.... It was still.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked along the railway embankment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Silly woman,” I thought, looking at the sky spangled with brilliant\\r\\nstars. “Even if one admits that omens sometimes tell the truth, what\\r\\nevil can happen to us? The misfortunes we have endured already, and\\r\\nwhich are facing us now, are so great that it is difficult to imagine\\r\\nanything worse. What further harm can you do a fish which has been\\r\\ncaught and fried and served up with sauce?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA poplar covered with hoar frost looked in the bluish darkness like a\\r\\ngiant wrapt in a shroud. It looked at me sullenly and dejectedly, as\\r\\nthough like me it realized its loneliness. I stood a long while looking\\r\\nat it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My youth is thrown away for nothing, like a useless cigarette end,”\\r\\n I went on musing. “My parents died when I was a little child; I was\\r\\nexpelled from the high school, I was born of a noble family, but I have\\r\\nreceived neither education nor breeding, and I have no more knowledge\\r\\nthan the humblest mechanic. I have no refuge, no relations, no friends,\\r\\nno work I like. I am not fitted for anything, and in the prime of my\\r\\npowers I am good for nothing but to be stuffed into this little station;\\r\\nI have known nothing but trouble and failure all my life. What can\\r\\nhappen worse?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRed lights came into sight in the distance. A train was moving towards\\r\\nme. The slumbering steppe listened to the sound of it. My thoughts were\\r\\nso bitter that it seemed to me that I was thinking aloud and that the\\r\\nmoan of the telegraph wire and the rumble of the train were expressing\\r\\nmy thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can happen worse? The loss of my wife?” I wondered. “Even that is\\r\\nnot terrible. It’s no good hiding it from my conscience: I don’t love my\\r\\nwife. I married her when I was only a wretched boy; now I am young and\\r\\nvigorous, and she has gone off and grown older and sillier, stuffed from\\r\\nher head to her heels with conventional ideas. What charm is there in\\r\\nher maudlin love, in her hollow chest, in her lusterless eyes? I put\\r\\nup with her, but I don’t love her. What can happen? My youth is being\\r\\nwasted, as the saying is, for a pinch of snuff. Women flit before my\\r\\neyes only in the carriage windows, like falling stars. Love I never had\\r\\nand have not. My manhood, my courage, my power of feeling are going to\\r\\nruin.... Everything is being thrown away like dirt, and all my wealth\\r\\nhere in the steppe is not worth a farthing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train rushed past me with a roar and indifferently cast the glow\\r\\nof its red lights upon me. I saw it stop by the green lights of the\\r\\nstation, stop for a minute and rumble off again. After walking a mile\\r\\nand a half I went back. Melancholy thoughts haunted me still. Painful\\r\\nas it was to me, yet I remember I tried as it were to make my thoughts\\r\\nstill gloomier and more melancholy. You know people who are vain and not\\r\\nvery clever have moments when the consciousness that they are miserable\\r\\naffords them positive satisfaction, and they even coquet with their\\r\\nmisery for their own entertainment. There was a great deal of truth\\r\\nin what I thought, but there was also a great deal that was absurd and\\r\\nconceited, and there was something boyishly defiant in my question:\\r\\n“What could happen worse?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what is there to happen?” I asked myself. “I think I have endured\\r\\neverything. I’ve been ill, I’ve lost money, I get reprimanded by my\\r\\nsuperiors every day, and I go hungry, and a mad wolf has run into the\\r\\nstation yard. What more is there? I have been insulted, humiliated,...\\r\\nand I have insulted others in my time. I have not been a criminal,\\r\\nit is true, but I don’t think I am capable of crime--I am not afraid of\\r\\nbeing hauled up for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two little clouds had moved away from the moon and stood at a little\\r\\ndistance, looking as though they were whispering about something which\\r\\nthe moon must not know. A light breeze was racing across the steppe,\\r\\nbringing the faint rumble of the retreating train.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife met me at the doorway. Her eyes were laughing gaily and her\\r\\nwhole face was beaming with good-humor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is news for you!” she whispered. “Make haste, go to your room and\\r\\nput on your new coat; we have a visitor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What visitor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aunt Natalya Petrovna has just come by the train.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What Natalya Petrovna?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The wife of my uncle Semyon Fyodoritch. You don’t know her. She is a\\r\\nvery nice, good woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably I frowned, for my wife looked grave and whispered rapidly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it is queer her having come, but don’t be cross, Nikolay, and\\r\\ndon’t be hard on her. She is unhappy, you know; Uncle Semyon Fyodoritch\\r\\nreally is ill-natured and tyrannical, it is difficult to live with him.\\r\\nShe says she will only stay three days with us, only till she gets a\\r\\nletter from her brother.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife whispered a great deal more nonsense to me about her despotic\\r\\nuncle; about the weakness of mankind in general and of young wives in\\r\\nparticular; about its being our duty to give shelter to all, even great\\r\\nsinners, and so on. Unable to make head or tail of it, I put on my new\\r\\ncoat and went to make acquaintance with my “aunt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA little woman with large black eyes was sitting at the table. My table,\\r\\nthe gray walls, my roughly-made sofa, everything to the tiniest grain of\\r\\ndust seemed to have grown younger and more cheerful in the presence\\r\\nof this new, young, beautiful, and dissolute creature, who had a most\\r\\nsubtle perfume about her. And that our visitor was a lady of easy virtue\\r\\nI could see from her smile, from her scent, from the peculiar way in\\r\\nwhich she glanced and made play with her eyelashes, from the tone in\\r\\nwhich she talked with my wife--a respectable woman. There was no need to\\r\\ntell me she had run away from her husband, that her husband was old and\\r\\ndespotic, that she was good-natured and lively; I took it all in at\\r\\nthe first glance. Indeed, it is doubtful whether there is a man in\\r\\nall Europe who cannot spot at the first glance a woman of a certain\\r\\ntemperament.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not know I had such a big nephew!” said my aunt, holding out her\\r\\nhand to me and smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I did not know I had such a pretty aunt,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper began over again. The cork flew with a bang out of the second\\r\\nbottle, and my aunt swallowed half a glassful at a gulp, and when my\\r\\nwife went out of the room for a moment my aunt did not scruple to drain\\r\\na full glass. I was drunk both with the wine and with the presence of a\\r\\nwoman. Do you remember the song?\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Eyes black as pitch, eyes full of passion,\\r\\n     Eyes burning bright and beautiful,\\r\\n     How I love you,\\r\\n     How I fear you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t remember what happened next. Anyone who wants to know how love\\r\\nbegins may read novels and long stories; I will put it shortly and in\\r\\nthe words of the same silly song:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “It was an evil hour\\r\\n     When first I met you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went head over heels to the devil. I remember a fearful,\\r\\nfrantic whirlwind which sent me flying round like a feather. It lasted\\r\\na long while, and swept from the face of the earth my wife and my aunt\\r\\nherself and my strength. From the little station in the steppe it has\\r\\nflung me, as you see, into this dark street.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow tell me what further evil can happen to me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER THE THEATRE\\r\\n\\r\\nNADYA ZELENIN had just come back with her mamma from the theatre where\\r\\nshe had seen a performance of “Yevgeny Onyegin.” As soon as she reached\\r\\nher own room she threw off her dress, let down her hair, and in her\\r\\npetticoat and white dressing-jacket hastily sat down to the table to\\r\\nwrite a letter like Tatyana’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I love you,” she wrote, “but you do not love me, do not love me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote it and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was only sixteen and did not yet love anyone. She knew that an\\r\\nofficer called Gorny and a student called Gruzdev loved her, but now\\r\\nafter the opera she wanted to be doubtful of their love. To be unloved\\r\\nand unhappy--how interesting that was. There is something beautiful,\\r\\ntouching, and poetical about it when one loves and the other is\\r\\nindifferent. Onyegin was interesting because he was not in love at all,\\r\\nand Tatyana was fascinating because she was so much in love; but if they\\r\\nhad been equally in love with each other and had been happy, they would\\r\\nperhaps have seemed dull.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave off declaring that you love me,” Nadya went on writing, thinking\\r\\nof Gorny. “I cannot believe it. You are very clever, cultivated,\\r\\nserious, you have immense talent, and perhaps a brilliant future awaits\\r\\nyou, while I am an uninteresting girl of no importance, and you know\\r\\nvery well that I should be only a hindrance in your life. It is true\\r\\nthat you were attracted by me and thought you had found your ideal in\\r\\nme, but that was a mistake, and now you are asking yourself in despair:\\r\\n‘Why did I meet that girl?’ And only your goodness of heart prevents you\\r\\nfrom owning it to yourself....”\\r\\n\\r\\nNadya felt sorry for herself, she began to cry, and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is hard for me to leave my mother and my brother, or I should take a\\r\\nnun’s veil and go whither chance may lead me. And you would be left free\\r\\nand would love another. Oh, if I were dead!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not make out what she had written through her tears; little\\r\\nrainbows were quivering on the table, on the floor, on the ceiling, as\\r\\nthough she were looking through a prism. She could not write, she sank\\r\\nback in her easy-chair and fell to thinking of Gorny.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy God! how interesting, how fascinating men were! Nadya recalled the\\r\\nfine expression, ingratiating, guilty, and soft, which came into the\\r\\nofficer’s face when one argued about music with him, and the effort he\\r\\nmade to prevent his voice from betraying his passion. In a society where\\r\\ncold haughtiness and indifference are regarded as signs of good breeding\\r\\nand gentlemanly bearing, one must conceal one’s passions. And he did\\r\\ntry to conceal them, but he did not succeed, and everyone knew very well\\r\\nthat he had a passionate love of music. The endless discussions about\\r\\nmusic and the bold criticisms of people who knew nothing about it kept\\r\\nhim always on the strain; he was frightened, timid, and silent. He\\r\\nplayed the piano magnificently, like a professional pianist, and if he\\r\\nhad not been in the army he would certainly have been a famous musician.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tears on her eyes dried. Nadya remembered that Gorny had declared\\r\\nhis love at a Symphony concert, and again downstairs by the hatstand\\r\\nwhere there was a tremendous draught blowing in all directions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very glad that you have at last made the acquaintance of Gruzdev,\\r\\nour student friend,” she went on writing. “He is a very clever man, and\\r\\nyou will be sure to like him. He came to see us yesterday and stayed\\r\\ntill two o’clock. We were all delighted with him, and I regretted that\\r\\nyou had not come. He said a great deal that was remarkable.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNadya laid her arms on the table and leaned her head on them, and her\\r\\nhair covered the letter. She recalled that the student, too, loved her,\\r\\nand that he had as much right to a letter from her as Gorny. Wouldn’t it\\r\\nbe better after all to write to Gruzdev? There was a stir of joy in her\\r\\nbosom for no reason whatever; at first the joy was small, and rolled\\r\\nin her bosom like an india-rubber ball; then it became more massive,\\r\\nbigger, and rushed like a wave. Nadya forgot Gorny and Gruzdev; her\\r\\nthoughts were in a tangle and her joy grew and grew; from her bosom it\\r\\npassed into her arms and legs, and it seemed as though a light, cool\\r\\nbreeze were breathing on her head and ruffling her hair. Her shoulders\\r\\nquivered with subdued laughter, the table and the lamp chimney shook,\\r\\ntoo, and tears from her eyes splashed on the letter. She could not\\r\\nstop laughing, and to prove to herself that she was not laughing about\\r\\nnothing she made haste to think of something funny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a funny poodle,” she said, feeling as though she would choke with\\r\\nlaughter. “What a funny poodle!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought how, after tea the evening before, Gruzdev had played with\\r\\nMaxim the poodle, and afterwards had told them about a very intelligent\\r\\npoodle who had run after a crow in the yard, and the crow had looked\\r\\nround at him and said: “Oh, you scamp!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poodle, not knowing he had to do with a learned crow, was fearfully\\r\\nconfused and retreated in perplexity, then began barking....\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I had better love Gruzdev,” Nadya decided, and she tore up the\\r\\nletter to Gorny.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fell to thinking of the student, of his love, of her love; but the\\r\\nthoughts in her head insisted on flowing in all directions, and she\\r\\nthought about everything--about her mother, about the street, about the\\r\\npencil, about the piano.... She thought of them joyfully, and felt\\r\\nthat everything was good, splendid, and her joy told her that this was\\r\\nnot all, that in a little while it would be better still. Soon it would\\r\\nbe spring, summer, going with her mother to Gorbiki. Gorny would come\\r\\nfor his furlough, would walk about the garden with her and make love\\r\\nto her. Gruzdev would come too. He would play croquet and skittles with\\r\\nher, and would tell her wonderful things. She had a passionate longing\\r\\nfor the garden, the darkness, the pure sky, the stars. Again her\\r\\nshoulders shook with laughter, and it seemed to her that there was a\\r\\nscent of wormwood in the room and that a twig was tapping at the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to her bed, sat down, and not knowing what to do with the\\r\\nimmense joy which filled her with yearning, she looked at the holy image\\r\\nhanging at the back of her bed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Lord God! Oh, Lord God!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA LADY’S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nNINE years ago Pyotr Sergeyitch, the deputy prosecutor, and I were\\r\\nriding towards evening in hay-making time to fetch the letters from the\\r\\nstation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was magnificent, but on our way back we heard a peal of\\r\\nthunder, and saw an angry black storm-cloud which was coming straight\\r\\ntowards us. The storm-cloud was approaching us and we were approaching\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst the background of it our house and church looked white and the\\r\\ntall poplars shone like silver. There was a scent of rain and mown hay.\\r\\nMy companion was in high spirits. He kept laughing and talking all sorts\\r\\nof nonsense. He said it would be nice if we could suddenly come upon a\\r\\nmedieval castle with turreted towers, with moss on it and owls, in\\r\\nwhich we could take shelter from the rain and in the end be killed by a\\r\\nthunderbolt....\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the first wave raced through the rye and a field of oats, there\\r\\nwas a gust of wind, and the dust flew round and round in the air. Pyotr\\r\\nSergeyitch laughed and spurred on his horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s fine!” he cried, “it’s splendid!”\\r\\n\\r\\nInfected by his gaiety, I too began laughing at the thought that in\\r\\na minute I should be drenched to the skin and might be struck by\\r\\nlightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiding swiftly in a hurricane when one is breathless with the wind, and\\r\\nfeels like a bird, thrills one and puts one’s heart in a flutter. By the\\r\\ntime we rode into our courtyard the wind had gone down, and big drops of\\r\\nrain were pattering on the grass and on the roofs. There was not a soul\\r\\nnear the stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nPyotr Sergeyitch himself took the bridles off, and led the horses to\\r\\ntheir stalls. I stood in the doorway waiting for him to finish, and\\r\\nwatching the slanting streaks of rain; the sweetish, exciting scent of\\r\\nhay was even stronger here than in the fields; the storm-clouds and the\\r\\nrain made it almost twilight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a crash!” said Pyotr Sergeyitch, coming up to me after a very loud\\r\\nrolling peal of thunder when it seemed as though the sky were split in\\r\\ntwo. “What do you say to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood beside me in the doorway and, still breathless from his rapid\\r\\nride, looked at me. I could see that he was admiring me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Natalya Vladimirovna,” he said, “I would give anything only to stay\\r\\nhere a little longer and look at you. You are lovely to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes looked at me with delight and supplication, his face was pale.\\r\\nOn his beard and mustache were glittering raindrops, and they, too,\\r\\nseemed to be looking at me with love.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I love you,” he said. “I love you, and I am happy at seeing you. I know\\r\\nyou cannot be my wife, but I want nothing, I ask nothing; only know that\\r\\nI love you. Be silent, do not answer me, take no notice of it, but only\\r\\nknow that you are dear to me and let me look at you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis rapture affected me too; I looked at his enthusiastic face, listened\\r\\nto his voice which mingled with the patter of the rain, and stood as\\r\\nthough spellbound, unable to stir.\\r\\n\\r\\nI longed to go on endlessly looking at his shining eyes and listening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You say nothing, and that is splendid,” said Pyotr Sergeyitch. “Go on\\r\\nbeing silent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt happy. I laughed with delight and ran through the drenching rain\\r\\nto the house; he laughed too, and, leaping as he went, ran after me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth drenched, panting, noisily clattering up the stairs like children,\\r\\nwe dashed into the room. My father and brother, who were not used to\\r\\nseeing me laughing and light-hearted, looked at me in surprise and began\\r\\nlaughing too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm-clouds had passed over and the thunder had ceased, but the\\r\\nraindrops still glittered on Pyotr Sergeyitch’s beard. The whole evening\\r\\ntill supper-time he was singing, whistling, playing noisily with the dog\\r\\nand racing about the room after it, so that he nearly upset the servant\\r\\nwith the samovar. And at supper he ate a great deal, talked nonsense,\\r\\nand maintained that when one eats fresh cucumbers in winter there is the\\r\\nfragrance of spring in one’s mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went to bed I lighted a candle and threw my window wide open, and\\r\\nan undefined feeling took possession of my soul. I remembered that I was\\r\\nfree and healthy, that I had rank and wealth, that I was beloved; above\\r\\nall, that I had rank and wealth, rank and wealth, my God! how nice that\\r\\nwas!... Then, huddling up in bed at a touch of cold which reached me\\r\\nfrom the garden with the dew, I tried to discover whether I loved Pyotr\\r\\nSergeyitch or not,... and fell asleep unable to reach any conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when in the morning I saw quivering patches of sunlight and the\\r\\nshadows of the lime trees on my bed, what had happened yesterday rose\\r\\nvividly in my memory. Life seemed to me rich, varied, full of charm.\\r\\nHumming, I dressed quickly and went out into the garden....\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what happened afterwards? Why--nothing. In the winter when we lived\\r\\nin town Pyotr Sergeyitch came to see us from time to time. Country\\r\\nacquaintances are charming only in the country and in summer; in the\\r\\ntown and in winter they lose their charm. When you pour out tea for them\\r\\nin the town it seems as though they are wearing other people’s coats,\\r\\nand as though they stirred their tea too long. In the town, too, Pyotr\\r\\nSergeyitch spoke sometimes of love, but the effect was not at all the\\r\\nsame as in the country. In the town we were more vividly conscious of\\r\\nthe wall that stood between us. I had rank and wealth, while he was\\r\\npoor, and he was not even a nobleman, but only the son of a deacon and\\r\\na deputy public prosecutor; we both of us--I through my youth and he for\\r\\nsome unknown reason--thought of that wall as very high and thick, and\\r\\nwhen he was with us in the town he would criticize aristocratic society\\r\\nwith a forced smile, and maintain a sullen silence when there was\\r\\nanyone else in the drawing-room. There is no wall that cannot be broken\\r\\nthrough, but the heroes of the modern romance, so far as I know them,\\r\\nare too timid, spiritless, lazy, and oversensitive, and are too ready to\\r\\nresign themselves to the thought that they are doomed to failure, that\\r\\npersonal life has disappointed them; instead of struggling they merely\\r\\ncriticize, calling the world vulgar and forgetting that their criticism\\r\\npasses little by little into vulgarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was loved, happiness was not far away, and seemed to be almost\\r\\ntouching me; I went on living in careless ease without trying to\\r\\nunderstand myself, not knowing what I expected or what I wanted from\\r\\nlife, and time went on and on.... People passed by me with their\\r\\nlove, bright days and warm nights flashed by, the nightingales sang, the\\r\\nhay smelt fragrant, and all this, sweet and overwhelming in remembrance,\\r\\npassed with me as with everyone rapidly, leaving no trace, was not\\r\\nprized, and vanished like mist.... Where is it all?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father is dead, I have grown older; everything that delighted me,\\r\\ncaressed me, gave me hope--the patter of the rain, the rolling of\\r\\nthe thunder, thoughts of happiness, talk of love--all that has become\\r\\nnothing but a memory, and I see before me a flat desert distance; on\\r\\nthe plain not one living soul, and out there on the horizon it is dark\\r\\nand terrible....\\r\\n\\r\\nA ring at the bell.... It is Pyotr Sergeyitch. When in the winter I\\r\\nsee the trees and remember how green they were for me in the summer I\\r\\nwhisper:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my darlings!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I see people with whom I spent my spring-time, I feel sorrowful\\r\\nand warm and whisper the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has long ago by my father’s good offices been transferred to town.\\r\\nHe looks a little older, a little fallen away. He has long given up\\r\\ndeclaring his love, has left off talking nonsense, dislikes his official\\r\\nwork, is ill in some way and disillusioned; he has given up trying to\\r\\nget anything out of life, and takes no interest in living. Now he has\\r\\nsat down by the hearth and looks in silence at the fire....\\r\\n\\r\\nNot knowing what to say I ask him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what have you to tell me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” he answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd silence again. The red glow of the fire plays about his melancholy\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of the past, and all at once my shoulders began quivering, my\\r\\nhead dropped, and I began weeping bitterly. I felt unbearably sorry for\\r\\nmyself and for this man, and passionately longed for what had passed\\r\\naway and what life refused us now. And now I did not think about rank\\r\\nand wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI broke into loud sobs, pressing my temples, and muttered:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God! my God! my life is wasted!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he sat and was silent, and did not say to me: “Don’t weep.” He\\r\\nunderstood that I must weep, and that the time for this had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw from his eyes that he was sorry for me; and I was sorry for him,\\r\\ntoo, and vexed with this timid, unsuccessful man who could not make a\\r\\nlife for me, nor for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I saw him to the door, he was, I fancied, purposely a long while\\r\\nputting on his coat. Twice he kissed my hand without a word, and looked\\r\\na long while into my tear-stained face. I believe at that moment he\\r\\nrecalled the storm, the streaks of rain, our laughter, my face that day;\\r\\nhe longed to say something to me, and he would have been glad to say it;\\r\\nbut he said nothing, he merely shook his head and pressed my hand. God\\r\\nhelp him!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seeing him out, I went back to my study and again sat on the\\r\\ncarpet before the fireplace; the red embers were covered with ash and\\r\\nbegan to grow dim. The frost tapped still more angrily at the windows,\\r\\nand the wind droned in the chimney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid came in and, thinking I was asleep, called my name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN EXILE\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD SEMYON, nicknamed Canny, and a young Tatar, whom no one knew by\\r\\nname, were sitting on the river-bank by the camp-fire; the other\\r\\nthree ferrymen were in the hut. Semyon, an old man of sixty, lean and\\r\\ntoothless, but broad shouldered and still healthy-looking, was drunk;\\r\\nhe would have gone in to sleep long before, but he had a bottle in his\\r\\npocket and he was afraid that the fellows in the hut would ask him for\\r\\nvodka. The Tatar was ill and weary, and wrapping himself up in his rags\\r\\nwas describing how nice it was in the Simbirsk province, and what a\\r\\nbeautiful and clever wife he had left behind at home. He was not more\\r\\nthan twenty five, and now by the light of the camp-fire, with his pale\\r\\nand sick, mournful face, he looked like a boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To be sure, it is not paradise here,” said Canny. “You can see for\\r\\nyourself, the water, the bare banks, clay, and nothing else....\\r\\nEaster has long passed and yet there is ice on the river, and this\\r\\nmorning there was snow...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bad! it’s bad!” said the Tatar, and looked round him in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark, cold river was flowing ten paces away; it grumbled, lapped\\r\\nagainst the hollow clay banks and raced on swiftly towards the far-away\\r\\nsea. Close to the bank there was the dark blur of a big barge, which the\\r\\nferrymen called a “karbos.” Far away on the further bank, lights, dying\\r\\ndown and flickering up again, zigzagged like little snakes; they were\\r\\nburning last year’s grass. And beyond the little snakes there was\\r\\ndarkness again. There little icicles could be heard knocking against the\\r\\nbarge. It was damp and cold....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tatar glanced at the sky. There were as many stars as at home, and\\r\\nthe same blackness all round, but something was lacking. At home in the\\r\\nSimbirsk province the stars were quite different, and so was the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bad! it’s bad!” he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will get used to it,” said Semyon, and he laughed. “Now you are\\r\\nyoung and foolish, the milk is hardly dry on your lips, and it seems to\\r\\nyou in your foolishness that you are more wretched than anyone; but the\\r\\ntime will come when you will say to yourself: ‘I wish no one a better\\r\\nlife than mine.’ You look at me. Within a week the floods will be over\\r\\nand we shall set up the ferry; you will all go wandering off about\\r\\nSiberia while I shall stay and shall begin going from bank to bank. I’ve\\r\\nbeen going like that for twenty-two years, day and night. The pike and\\r\\nthe salmon are under the water while I am on the water. And thank God\\r\\nfor it, I want nothing; God give everyone such a life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tatar threw some dry twigs on the camp-fire, lay down closer to the\\r\\nblaze, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My father is a sick man. When he dies my mother and wife will come\\r\\nhere. They have promised.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what do you want your wife and mother for?” asked Canny. “That’s\\r\\nmere foolishness, my lad. It’s the devil confounding you, damn his soul!\\r\\nDon’t you listen to him, the cursed one. Don’t let him have his way. He\\r\\nis at you about the women, but you spite him; say, ‘I don’t want them!’\\r\\nHe is on at you about freedom, but you stand up to him and say: ‘I\\r\\ndon’t want it!’ I want nothing, neither father nor mother, nor wife, nor\\r\\nfreedom, nor post, nor paddock; I want nothing, damn their souls!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSemyon took a pull at the bottle and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not a simple peasant, not of the working class, but the son of\\r\\na deacon, and when I was free I lived at Kursk; I used to wear a\\r\\nfrockcoat, and now I have brought myself to such a pass that I can sleep\\r\\nnaked on the ground and eat grass. And I wish no one a better life. I\\r\\nwant nothing and I am afraid of nobody, and the way I look at it is that\\r\\nthere is nobody richer and freer than I am. When they sent me here from\\r\\nRussia from the first day I stuck it out; I want nothing! The devil was\\r\\nat me about my wife and about my home and about freedom, but I told him:\\r\\n‘I want nothing.’ I stuck to it, and here you see I live well, and I\\r\\ndon’t complain, and if anyone gives way to the devil and listens to him,\\r\\nif but once, he is lost, there is no salvation for him: he is sunk in\\r\\nthe bog to the crown of his head and will never get out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not only a foolish peasant like you, but even gentlemen,\\r\\nwell-educated people, are lost. Fifteen years ago they sent a gentleman\\r\\nhere from Russia. He hadn’t shared something with his brothers and had\\r\\nforged something in a will. They did say he was a prince or a baron, but\\r\\nmaybe he was simply an official--who knows? Well, the gentleman\\r\\narrived here, and first thing he bought himself a house and land in\\r\\nMuhortinskoe. ‘I want to live by my own work,’ says he, ‘in the sweat\\r\\nof my brow, for I am not a gentleman now,’ says he, ‘but a settler.’\\r\\n‘Well,’ says I, ‘God help you, that’s the right thing.’ He was a young\\r\\nman then, busy and careful; he used to mow himself and catch fish and\\r\\nride sixty miles on horseback. Only this is what happened: from the very\\r\\nfirst year he took to riding to Gyrino for the post; he used to stand on\\r\\nmy ferry and sigh: ‘Ech, Semyon, how long it is since they sent me any\\r\\nmoney from home!’ ‘You don’t want money, Vassily Sergeyitch,’ says I.\\r\\n‘What use is it to you? You cast away the past, and forget it as though\\r\\nit had never been at all, as though it had been a dream, and begin to\\r\\nlive anew. Don’t listen to the devil,’ says I; ‘he will bring you to no\\r\\ngood, he’ll draw you into a snare. Now you want money,’ says I, ‘but in\\r\\na very little while you’ll be wanting something else, and then more and\\r\\nmore. If you want to be happy,’ says I, the chief thing is not to\\r\\nwant anything. Yes.... If,’ says I, ‘if Fate has wronged you and me\\r\\ncruelly it’s no good asking for her favor and bowing down to her, but\\r\\nyou despise her and laugh at her, or else she will laugh at you.’ That’s\\r\\nwhat I said to him....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two years later I ferried him across to this side, and he was rubbing\\r\\nhis hands and laughing. ‘I am going to Gyrino to meet my wife,’ says\\r\\nhe. ‘She was sorry for me,’ says he; ‘she has come. She is good and\\r\\nkind.’ And he was breathless with joy. So a day later he came with his\\r\\nwife. A beautiful young lady in a hat; in her arms was a baby girl.\\r\\nAnd lots of luggage of all sorts. And my Vassily Sergeyitch was fussing\\r\\nround her; he couldn’t take his eyes off her and couldn’t say enough in\\r\\npraise of her. ‘Yes, brother Semyon, even in Siberia people can live!’\\r\\n‘Oh, all right,’ thinks I, ‘it will be a different tale presently.’\\r\\nAnd from that time forward he went almost every week to inquire whether\\r\\nmoney had not come from Russia. He wanted a lot of money. ‘She is losing\\r\\nher youth and beauty here in Siberia for my sake,’ says he, ‘and sharing\\r\\nmy bitter lot with me, and so I ought,’ says he, ‘to provide her with\\r\\nevery comfort....’\\r\\n\\r\\n“To make it livelier for the lady he made acquaintance with the\\r\\nofficials and all sorts of riff-raff. And of course he had to give food\\r\\nand drink to all that crew, and there had to be a piano and a\\r\\nshaggy lapdog on the sofa--plague take it!... Luxury, in fact,\\r\\nself-indulgence. The lady did not stay with him long. How could she? The\\r\\nclay, the water, the cold, no vegetables for you, no fruit. All around\\r\\nyou ignorant and drunken people and no sort of manners, and she was\\r\\na spoilt lady from Petersburg or Moscow.... To be sure she moped.\\r\\nBesides, her husband, say what you like, was not a gentleman now, but a\\r\\nsettler--not the same rank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three years later, I remember, on the eve of the Assumption, there was\\r\\nshouting from the further bank. I went over with the ferry, and what do\\r\\nI see but the lady, all wrapped up, and with her a young gentleman, an\\r\\nofficial. A sledge with three horses.... I ferried them across here,\\r\\nthey got in and away like the wind. They were soon lost to sight. And\\r\\ntowards morning Vassily Sergeyitch galloped down to the ferry. ‘Didn’t\\r\\nmy wife come this way with a gentleman in spectacles, Semyon?’ ‘She\\r\\ndid,’ said I; ‘you may look for the wind in the fields!’ He galloped in\\r\\npursuit of them. For five days and nights he was riding after them. When\\r\\nI ferried him over to the other side afterwards, he flung himself on\\r\\nthe ferry and beat his head on the boards of the ferry and howled. ‘So\\r\\nthat’s how it is,’ says I. I laughed, and reminded him ‘people can live\\r\\neven in Siberia!’ And he beat his head harder than ever....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he began longing for freedom. His wife had slipped off to Russia,\\r\\nand of course he was drawn there to see her and to get her away from her\\r\\nlover. And he took, my lad, to galloping almost every day, either to\\r\\nthe post or the town to see the commanding officer; he kept sending in\\r\\npetitions for them to have mercy on him and let him go back home; and\\r\\nhe used to say that he had spent some two hundred roubles on telegrams\\r\\nalone. He sold his land and mortgaged his house to the Jews. He grew\\r\\ngray and bent, and yellow in the face, as though he was in consumption.\\r\\nIf he talked to you he would go, khee--khee--khee,... and there were\\r\\ntears in his eyes. He kept rushing about like this with petitions for\\r\\neight years, but now he has grown brighter and more cheerful again: he\\r\\nhas found another whim to give way to. You see, his daughter has grown\\r\\nup. He looks at her, and she is the apple of his eye. And to tell the\\r\\ntruth she is all right, good-looking, with black eyebrows and a lively\\r\\ndisposition. Every Sunday he used to ride with her to church in Gyrino.\\r\\nThey used to stand on the ferry, side by side, she would laugh and he\\r\\ncould not take his eyes off her. ‘Yes, Semyon,’ says he, ‘people can\\r\\nlive even in Siberia. Even in Siberia there is happiness. Look,’ says\\r\\nhe, ‘what a daughter I have got! I warrant you wouldn’t find another\\r\\nlike her for a thousand versts round.’ ‘Your daughter is all right,’\\r\\nsays I, ‘that’s true, certainly.’ But to myself I thought: ‘Wait a bit,\\r\\nthe wench is young, her blood is dancing, she wants to live, and there\\r\\nis no life here.’ And she did begin to pine, my lad.... She faded and\\r\\nfaded, and now she can hardly crawl about. Consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you see what Siberian happiness is, damn its soul! You see how\\r\\npeople can live in Siberia.... He has taken to going from one doctor\\r\\nto another and taking them home with him. As soon as he hears that two\\r\\nor three hundred miles away there is a doctor or a sorcerer, he will\\r\\ndrive to fetch him. A terrible lot of money he spent on doctors, and to\\r\\nmy thinking he had better have spent the money on drink.... She’ll\\r\\ndie just the same. She is certain to die, and then it will be all over\\r\\nwith him. He’ll hang himself from grief or run away to Russia--that’s a\\r\\nsure thing. He’ll run away and they’ll catch him, then he will be tried,\\r\\nsent to prison, he will have a taste of the lash....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good! good!” said the Tatar, shivering with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is good?” asked Canny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His wife, his daughter.... What of prison and what of\\r\\nsorrow!--anyway, he did see his wife and his daughter.... You say,\\r\\nwant nothing. But ‘nothing’ is bad! His wife lived with him three\\r\\nyears--that was a gift from God. ‘Nothing’ is bad, but three years is\\r\\ngood. How not understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShivering and hesitating, with effort picking out the Russian words of\\r\\nwhich he knew but few, the Tatar said that God forbid one should fall\\r\\nsick and die in a strange land, and be buried in the cold and dark\\r\\nearth; that if his wife came to him for one day, even for one hour, that\\r\\nfor such happiness he would be ready to bear any suffering and to thank\\r\\nGod. Better one day of happiness than nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he described again what a beautiful and clever wife he had left\\r\\nat home. Then, clutching his head in both hands, he began crying and\\r\\nassuring Semyon that he was not guilty, and was suffering for nothing.\\r\\nHis two brothers and an uncle had carried off a peasant’s horses, and\\r\\nhad beaten the old man till he was half dead, and the commune had not\\r\\njudged fairly, but had contrived a sentence by which all the three\\r\\nbrothers were sent to Siberia, while the uncle, a rich man, was left at\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will get used to it!” said Semyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tatar was silent, and stared with tear-stained eyes at the fire;\\r\\nhis face expressed bewilderment and fear, as though he still did\\r\\nnot understand why he was here in the darkness and the wet, beside\\r\\nstrangers, and not in the Simbirsk province.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanny lay near the fire, chuckled at something, and began humming a song\\r\\nin an undertone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What joy has she with her father?” he said a little later. “He loves\\r\\nher and he rejoices in her, that’s true; but, mate, you must mind your\\r\\nps and qs with him, he is a strict old man, a harsh old man. And young\\r\\nwenches don’t want strictness. They want petting and ha-ha-ha! and\\r\\nho-ho-ho! and scent and pomade. Yes.... Ech! life, life,” sighed\\r\\nSemyon, and he got up heavily. “The vodka is all gone, so it is time to\\r\\nsleep. Eh? I am going, my lad....”\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft alone, the Tatar put on more twigs, lay down and stared at the\\r\\nfire; he began thinking of his own village and of his wife. If his wife\\r\\ncould only come for a month, for a day; and then if she liked she might\\r\\ngo back again. Better a month or even a day than nothing. But if his\\r\\nwife kept her promise and came, what would he have to feed her on? Where\\r\\ncould she live here?\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there were not something to eat, how could she live?” the Tatar\\r\\nasked aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was paid only ten kopecks for working all day and all night at the\\r\\noar; it is true that travelers gave him tips for tea and for vodkas but\\r\\nthe men shared all they received among themselves, and gave nothing\\r\\nto the Tatar, but only laughed at him. And from poverty he was hungry,\\r\\ncold, and frightened.... Now, when his whole body was aching and\\r\\nshivering, he ought to go into the hut and lie down to sleep; but he had\\r\\nnothing to cover him there, and it was colder than on the river-bank;\\r\\nhere he had nothing to cover him either, but at least he could make up\\r\\nthe fire....\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another week, when the floods were quite over and they set the ferry\\r\\ngoing, none of the ferrymen but Semyon would be wanted, and the Tatar\\r\\nwould begin going from village to village begging for alms and for work.\\r\\nHis wife was only seventeen; she was beautiful, spoilt, and shy; could\\r\\nshe possibly go from village to village begging alms with her face\\r\\nunveiled? No, it was terrible even to think of that....\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was already getting light; the barge, the bushes of willow on the\\r\\nwater, and the waves could be clearly discerned, and if one looked round\\r\\nthere was the steep clay slope; at the bottom of it the hut thatched\\r\\nwith dingy brown straw, and the huts of the village lay clustered higher\\r\\nup. The cocks were already crowing in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rusty red clay slope, the barge, the river, the strange, unkind\\r\\npeople, hunger, cold, illness, perhaps all that was not real. Most\\r\\nlikely it was all a dream, thought the Tatar. He felt that he was\\r\\nasleep and heard his own snoring.... Of course he was at home in the\\r\\nSimbirsk province, and he had only to call his wife by name for her to\\r\\nanswer; and in the next room was his mother.... What terrible dreams\\r\\nthere are, though! What are they for? The Tatar smiled and opened his\\r\\neyes. What river was this, the Volga?\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow was falling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Boat!” was shouted on the further side. “Boat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tatar woke up, and went to wake his mates and row over to the other\\r\\nside. The ferrymen came on to the river-bank, putting on their torn\\r\\nsheepskins as they walked, swearing with voices husky from sleepiness\\r\\nand shivering from the cold. On waking from their sleep, the river, from\\r\\nwhich came a breath of piercing cold, seemed to strike them as revolting\\r\\nand horrible. They jumped into the barge without hurrying themselves....\\r\\nThe Tatar and the three ferrymen took the long, broad-bladed oars,\\r\\nwhich in the darkness looked like the claws of crabs; Semyon leaned his\\r\\nstomach against the tiller. The shout on the other side still continued,\\r\\nand two shots were fired from a revolver, probably with the idea that\\r\\nthe ferrymen were asleep or had gone to the pot-house in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, you have plenty of time,” said Semyon in the tone of a man\\r\\nconvinced that there was no necessity in this world to hurry--that it\\r\\nwould lead to nothing, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy, clumsy barge moved away from the bank and floated between the\\r\\nwillow-bushes, and only the willows slowly moving back showed that the\\r\\nbarge was not standing still but moving. The ferrymen swung the\\r\\noars evenly in time; Semyon lay with his stomach on the tiller and,\\r\\ndescribing a semicircle in the air, flew from one side to the other.\\r\\nIn the darkness it looked as though the men were sitting on some\\r\\nantediluvian animal with long paws, and were moving on it through\\r\\na cold, desolate land, the land of which one sometimes dreams in\\r\\nnightmares.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed beyond the willows and floated out into the open. The creak\\r\\nand regular splash of the oars was heard on the further shore, and a\\r\\nshout came: “Make haste! make haste!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother ten minutes passed, and the barge banged heavily against the\\r\\nlanding-stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it keeps sprinkling and sprinkling,” muttered Semyon, wiping the\\r\\nsnow from his face; “and where it all comes from God only knows.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the bank stood a thin man of medium height in a jacket lined with fox\\r\\nfur and in a white lambskin cap. He was standing at a little distance\\r\\nfrom his horses and not moving; he had a gloomy, concentrated\\r\\nexpression, as though he were trying to remember something and angry\\r\\nwith his untrustworthy memory. When Semyon went up to him and took off\\r\\nhis cap, smiling, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am hastening to Anastasyevka. My daughter’s worse again, and they say\\r\\nthat there is a new doctor at Anastasyevka.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dragged the carriage on to the barge and floated back. The man whom\\r\\nSemyon addressed as Vassily Sergeyitch stood all the time motionless,\\r\\ntightly compressing his thick lips and staring off into space; when his\\r\\ncoachman asked permission to smoke in his presence he made no answer, as\\r\\nthough he had not heard. Semyon, lying with his stomach on the tiller,\\r\\nlooked mockingly at him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even in Siberia people can live--can li-ive!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a triumphant expression on Canny’s face, as though he had\\r\\nproved something and was delighted that things had happened as he\\r\\nhad foretold. The unhappy helplessness of the man in the foxskin coat\\r\\nevidently afforded him great pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s muddy driving now, Vassily Sergeyitch,” he said when the horses\\r\\nwere harnessed again on the bank. “You should have put off going for\\r\\nanother fortnight, when it will be drier. Or else not have gone at all.\\r\\n... If any good would come of your going--but as you know yourself,\\r\\npeople have been driving about for years and years, day and night, and\\r\\nit’s always been no use. That’s the truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVassily Sergeyitch tipped him without a word, got into his carriage and\\r\\ndrove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, he has galloped off for a doctor!” said Semyon, shrinking from\\r\\nthe cold. “But looking for a good doctor is like chasing the wind in the\\r\\nfields or catching the devil by the tail, plague take your soul! What a\\r\\nqueer chap, Lord forgive me a sinner!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tatar went up to Canny, and, looking at him with hatred and\\r\\nrepulsion, shivering, and mixing Tatar words with his broken Russian,\\r\\nsaid: “He is good... good; but you are bad! You are bad! The\\r\\ngentleman is a good soul, excellent, and you are a beast, bad! The\\r\\ngentleman is alive, but you are a dead carcass.... God created man to\\r\\nbe alive, and to have joy and grief and sorrow; but you want nothing,\\r\\nso you are not alive, you are stone, clay! A stone wants nothing and you\\r\\nwant nothing. You are a stone, and God does not love you, but He loves\\r\\nthe gentleman!”\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone laughed; the Tatar frowned contemptuously, and with a wave\\r\\nof his hand wrapped himself in his rags and went to the campfire. The\\r\\nferrymen and Semyon sauntered to the hut.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s cold,” said one ferryman huskily as he stretched himself on the\\r\\nstraw with which the damp clay floor was covered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it’s not warm,” another assented. “It’s a dog’s life....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all lay down. The door was thrown open by the wind and the snow\\r\\ndrifted into the hut; nobody felt inclined to get up and shut the door:\\r\\nthey were cold, and it was too much trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am all right,” said Semyon as he began to doze. “I wouldn’t wish\\r\\nanyone a better life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a tough one, we all know. Even the devils won’t take you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSounds like a dog’s howling came from outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that? Who’s there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the Tatar crying.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say.... He’s a queer one!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’ll get u-used to it!” said Semyon, and at once fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others were soon asleep too. The door remained unclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CATTLE-DEALERS\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE long goods train has been standing for hours in the little station.\\r\\nThe engine is as silent as though its fire had gone out; there is not a\\r\\nsoul near the train or in the station yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pale streak of light comes from one of the vans and glides over the\\r\\nrails of a siding. In that van two men are sitting on an outspread cape:\\r\\none is an old man with a big gray beard, wearing a sheepskin coat and a\\r\\nhigh lambskin hat, somewhat like a busby; the other a beardless youth\\r\\nin a threadbare cloth reefer jacket and muddy high boots. They are the\\r\\nowners of the goods. The old man sits, his legs stretched out before\\r\\nhim, musing in silence; the young man half reclines and softly strums\\r\\non a cheap accordion. A lantern with a tallow candle in it is hanging on\\r\\nthe wall near them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe van is quite full. If one glances in through the dim light of\\r\\nthe lantern, for the first moment the eyes receive an impression of\\r\\nsomething shapeless, monstrous, and unmistakably alive, something very\\r\\nmuch like gigantic crabs which move their claws and feelers, crowd\\r\\ntogether, and noiselessly climb up the walls to the ceiling; but if\\r\\none looks more closely, horns and their shadows, long lean backs, dirty\\r\\nhides, tails, eyes begin to stand out in the dusk. They are cattle and\\r\\ntheir shadows. There are eight of them in the van. Some turn round and\\r\\nstare at the men and swing their tails. Others try to stand or lie down\\r\\nmore comfortably. They are crowded. If one lies down the others must\\r\\nstand and huddle closer. No manger, no halter, no litter, not a wisp of\\r\\nhay....*\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the old man pulls out of his pocket a silver watch and looks at\\r\\nthe time: a quarter past two.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been here nearly two hours,” he says, yawning. “Better go and\\r\\nstir them up, or we may be here till morning. They have gone to sleep,\\r\\nor goodness knows what they are up to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man gets up and, followed by his long shadow, cautiously gets\\r\\ndown from the van into the darkness. He makes his way along beside the\\r\\ntrain to the engine, and after passing some two dozen vans sees a red\\r\\nopen furnace; a human figure sits motionless facing it; its peaked cap,\\r\\nnose, and knees are lighted up by the crimson glow, all the rest is\\r\\nblack and can scarcely be distinguished in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are we going to stay here much longer?” asks the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo answer. The motionless figure is evidently asleep. The old man clears\\r\\nhis throat impatiently and, shrinking from the penetrating damp, walks\\r\\nround the engine, and as he does so the brilliant light of the two\\r\\nengine lamps dazzles his eyes for an instant and makes the night even\\r\\nblacker to him; he goes to the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe platform and steps of the station are wet. Here and there are white\\r\\npatches of freshly fallen melting snow. In the station itself it is\\r\\nlight and as hot as a steam-bath. There is a smell of paraffin. Except\\r\\nfor the weighing-machine and a yellow seat on which a man wearing a\\r\\nguard’s uniform is asleep, there is no furniture in the place at all.\\r\\nOn the left are two wide-open doors. Through one of them the telegraphic\\r\\napparatus and a lamp with a green shade on it can be seen; through the\\r\\nother, a small room, half of it taken up by a dark cupboard. In\\r\\nthis room the head guard and the engine-driver are sitting on the\\r\\nwindow-sill. They are both feeling a cap with their fingers and\\r\\ndisputing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s not real beaver, it’s imitation,” says the engine-driver. “Real\\r\\nbeaver is not like that. Five roubles would be a high price for the\\r\\nwhole cap, if you care to know!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know a great deal about it,...” the head guard says, offended.\\r\\n“Five roubles, indeed! Here, we will ask the merchant. Mr. Malahin,” he\\r\\nsays, addressing the old man, “what do you say: is this imitation beaver\\r\\nor real?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Malahin takes the cap into his hand, and with the air of a\\r\\nconnoisseur pinches the fur, blows on it, sniffs at it, and a\\r\\ncontemptuous smile lights up his angry face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be imitation!” he says gleefully. “Imitation it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA dispute follows. The guard maintains that the cap is real beaver, and\\r\\nthe engine-driver and Malahin try to persuade him that it is not. In the\\r\\nmiddle of the argument the old man suddenly remembers the object of his\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beaver and cap is all very well, but the train’s standing still,\\r\\ngentlemen!” he says. “Who is it we are waiting for? Let us start!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us,” the guard agrees. “We will smoke another cigarette and go on.\\r\\nBut there is no need to be in a hurry.... We shall be delayed at the\\r\\nnext station anyway!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should we?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well.... We are too much behind time.... If you are late at\\r\\none station you can’t help being delayed at the other stations to let\\r\\nthe trains going the opposite way pass. Whether we set off now or in\\r\\nthe morning we shan’t be number fourteen. We shall have to be number\\r\\ntwenty-three.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how do you make that out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMalahin looks at the guard, reflects, and mutters mechanically as though\\r\\nto himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n“God be my judge, I have reckoned it and even jotted it down in a\\r\\nnotebook; we have wasted thirty-four hours standing still on the\\r\\njourney. If you go on like this, either the cattle will die, or they\\r\\nwon’t pay me two roubles for the meat when I do get there. It’s not\\r\\ntraveling, but ruination.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guard raises his eyebrows and sighs with an air that seems to say:\\r\\n“All that is unhappily true!” The engine-driver sits silent, dreamily\\r\\nlooking at the cap. From their faces one can see that they have a secret\\r\\nthought in common, which they do not utter, not because they want to\\r\\nconceal it, but because such thoughts are much better expressed by signs\\r\\nthan by words. And the old man understands. He feels in his pocket,\\r\\ntakes out a ten-rouble note, and without preliminary words, without any\\r\\nchange in the tone of his voice or the expression of his face, but with\\r\\nthe confidence and directness with which probably only Russians give and\\r\\ntake bribes, he gives the guard the note. The latter takes it, folds it\\r\\nin four, and without undue haste puts it in his pocket. After that all\\r\\nthree go out of the room, and waking the sleeping guard on the way, go\\r\\non to the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What weather!” grumbles the head guard, shrugging his shoulders. “You\\r\\ncan’t see your hand before your face.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it’s vile weather.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the window they can see the flaxen head of the telegraph clerk\\r\\nappear beside the green lamp and the telegraphic apparatus; soon after\\r\\nanother head, bearded and wearing a red cap, appears beside it--no doubt\\r\\nthat of the station-master. The station-master bends down to the table,\\r\\nreads something on a blue form, rapidly passing his cigarette along the\\r\\nlines.... Malahin goes to his van.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man, his companion, is still half reclining and hardly audibly\\r\\nstrumming on the accordion. He is little more than a boy, with no\\r\\ntrace of a mustache; his full white face with its broad cheek-bones is\\r\\nchildishly dreamy; his eyes have a melancholy and tranquil look unlike\\r\\nthat of a grown-up person, but he is broad, strong, heavy and rough like\\r\\nthe old man; he does not stir nor shift his position, as though he is\\r\\nnot equal to moving his big body. It seems as though any movement he\\r\\nmade would tear his clothes and be so noisy as to frighten both him and\\r\\nthe cattle. From under his big fat fingers that clumsily pick out the\\r\\nstops and keys of the accordion comes a steady flow of thin, tinkling\\r\\nsounds which blend into a simple, monotonous little tune; he listens to\\r\\nit, and is evidently much pleased with his performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell rings, but with such a muffled note that it seems to come from\\r\\nfar away. A hurried second bell soon follows, then a third and the\\r\\nguard’s whistle. A minute passes in profound silence; the van does not\\r\\nmove, it stands still, but vague sounds begin to come from beneath it,\\r\\nlike the crunch of snow under sledge-runners; the van begins to shake\\r\\nand the sounds cease. Silence reigns again. But now comes the clank of\\r\\nbuffers, the violent shock makes the van start and, as it were, give a\\r\\nlurch forward, and all the cattle fall against one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“May you be served the same in the world to come,” grumbles the old man,\\r\\nsetting straight his cap, which had slipped on the back of his head from\\r\\nthe jolt. “He’ll maim all my cattle like this!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha gets up without a word and, taking one of the fallen beasts by the\\r\\nhorns, helps it to get on to its legs.... The jolt is followed by a\\r\\nstillness again. The sounds of crunching snow come from under the van\\r\\nagain, and it seems as though the train had moved back a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will be another jolt in a minute,” says the old man. And the\\r\\nconvulsive quiver does, in fact, run along the train, there is a\\r\\ncrashing sound and the bullocks fall on one another again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a job!” says Yasha, listening. “The train must be heavy. It seems\\r\\nit won’t move.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not heavy before, but now it has suddenly got heavy. No, my\\r\\nlad, the guard has not gone shares with him, I expect. Go and take him\\r\\nsomething, or he will be jolting us till morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha takes a three-rouble note from the old man and jumps out of the\\r\\nvan. The dull thud of his heavy footsteps resounds outside the van and\\r\\ngradually dies away. Stillness.... In the next van a bullock utters a\\r\\nprolonged subdued “moo,” as though it were singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha comes back. A cold damp wind darts into the van.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut the door, Yasha, and we will go to bed,” says the old man. “Why\\r\\nburn a candle for nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha moves the heavy door; there is a sound of a whistle, the engine\\r\\nand the train set off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s cold,” mutters the old man, stretching himself on the cape and\\r\\nlaying his head on a bundle. “It is very different at home! It’s warm\\r\\nand clean and soft, and there is room to say your prayers, but here\\r\\nwe are worse off than any pigs. It’s four days and nights since I have\\r\\ntaken off my boots.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha, staggering from the jolting of the train, opens the lantern and\\r\\nsnuffs out the wick with his wet fingers. The light flares up, hisses\\r\\nlike a frying pan and goes out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my lad,” Malahin goes on, as he feels Yasha lie down beside him\\r\\nand the young man’s huge back huddle against his own, “it’s cold. There\\r\\nis a draught from every crack. If your mother or your sister were to\\r\\nsleep here for one night they would be dead by morning. There it is, my\\r\\nlad, you wouldn’t study and go to the high school like your brothers, so\\r\\nyou must take the cattle with your father. It’s your own fault, you have\\r\\nonly yourself to blame.... Your brothers are asleep in their beds\\r\\nnow, they are snug under the bedclothes, but you, the careless and lazy\\r\\none, are in the same box as the cattle.... Yes.... ”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man’s words are inaudible in the noise of the train, but for a\\r\\nlong time he goes on muttering, sighing and clearing his throat....\\r\\nThe cold air in the railway van grows thicker and more stifling. The\\r\\npungent odor of fresh dung and smoldering candle makes it so repulsive\\r\\nand acrid that it irritates Yasha’s throat and chest as he falls asleep.\\r\\nHe coughs and sneezes, while the old man, being accustomed to it,\\r\\nbreathes with his whole chest as though nothing were amiss, and merely\\r\\nclears his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo judge from the swaying of the van and the rattle of the wheels the\\r\\ntrain is moving rapidly and unevenly. The engine breathes heavily,\\r\\nsnorting out of time with the pulsation of the train, and altogether\\r\\nthere is a medley of sounds. The bullocks huddle together uneasily and\\r\\nknock their horns against the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old man wakes up, the deep blue sky of early morning is peeping\\r\\nin at the cracks and at the little uncovered window. He feels unbearably\\r\\ncold, especially in the back and the feet. The train is standing still;\\r\\nYasha, sleepy and morose, is busy with the cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man wakes up out of humor. Frowning and gloomy, he clears his\\r\\nthroat angrily and looks from under his brows at Yasha who, supporting a\\r\\nbullock with his powerful shoulder and slightly lifting it, is trying to\\r\\ndisentangle its leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you last night that the cords were too long,” mutters the old\\r\\nman; “but no, ‘It’s not too long, Daddy.’ There’s no making you do\\r\\nanything, you will have everything your own way.... Blockhead!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe angrily moves the door open and the light rushes into the van. A\\r\\npassenger train is standing exactly opposite the door, and behind it a\\r\\nred building with a roofed-in platform--a big station with a refreshment\\r\\nbar. The roofs and bridges of the trains, the earth, the sleepers, all\\r\\nare covered with a thin coating of fluffy, freshly fallen snow. In the\\r\\nspaces between the carriages of the passenger train the passengers can\\r\\nbe seen moving to and fro, and a red-haired, red-faced gendarme walking\\r\\nup and down; a waiter in a frock-coat and a snow-white shirt-front,\\r\\nlooking cold and sleepy, and probably very much dissatisfied with his\\r\\nfate, is running along the platform carrying a glass of tea and two\\r\\nrusks on a tray.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man gets up and begins saying his prayers towards the east.\\r\\nYasha, having finished with the bullock and put down the spade in the\\r\\ncorner, stands beside him and says his prayers also. He merely moves\\r\\nhis lips and crosses himself; the father prays in a loud whisper and\\r\\npronounces the end of each prayer aloud and distinctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“... And the life of the world to come. Amen,” the old man says aloud,\\r\\ndraws in a breath, and at once whispers another prayer, rapping out\\r\\nclearly and firmly at the end: “... and lay calves upon Thy altar!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter saying his prayers, Yasha hurriedly crosses himself and says:\\r\\n“Five kopecks, please.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on being given the five-kopeck piece, he takes a red copper teapot\\r\\nand runs to the station for boiling water. Taking long jumps over\\r\\nthe rails and sleepers, leaving huge tracks in the feathery snow,\\r\\nand pouring away yesterday’s tea out of the teapot he runs to the\\r\\nrefreshment room and jingles his five-kopeck piece against his teapot.\\r\\nFrom the van the bar-keeper can be seen pushing away the big teapot and\\r\\nrefusing to give half of his samovar for five kopecks, but Yasha\\r\\nturns the tap himself and, spreading wide his elbows so as not to be\\r\\ninterfered with fills his teapot with boiling water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damned blackguard!” the bar-keeper shouts after him as he runs back to\\r\\nthe railway van.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scowling face of Malahin grows a little brighter over the tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know how to eat and drink, but we don’t remember our work. Yesterday\\r\\nwe could do nothing all day but eat and drink, and I’ll be bound we\\r\\nforgot to put down what we spent. What a memory! Lord have mercy on us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man recalls aloud the expenditure of the day before, and writes\\r\\ndown in a tattered notebook where and how much he had given to guards,\\r\\nengine-drivers, oilers....\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the passenger train has long ago gone off, and an engine\\r\\nruns backwards and forwards on the empty line, apparently without any\\r\\ndefinite object, but simply enjoying its freedom. The sun has risen and\\r\\nis playing on the snow; bright drops are falling from the station roof\\r\\nand the tops of the vans.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished his tea, the old man lazily saunters from the van to the\\r\\nstation. Here in the middle of the first-class waiting-room he sees the\\r\\nfamiliar figure of the guard standing beside the station-master, a young\\r\\nman with a handsome beard and in a magnificent rough woollen overcoat.\\r\\nThe young man, probably new to his position, stands in the same place,\\r\\ngracefully shifting from one foot to the other like a good racehorse,\\r\\nlooks from side to side, salutes everyone that passes by, smiles and\\r\\nscrews up his eyes.... He is red-cheeked, sturdy, and good-humored;\\r\\nhis face is full of eagerness, and is as fresh as though he had just\\r\\nfallen from the sky with the feathery snow. Seeing Malahin, the guard\\r\\nsighs guiltily and throws up his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can’t go number fourteen,” he says. “We are very much behind time.\\r\\nAnother train has gone with that number.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master rapidly looks through some forms, then turns his\\r\\nbeaming blue eyes upon Malahin, and, his face radiant with smiles and\\r\\nfreshness, showers questions on him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are Mr. Malahin? You have the cattle? Eight vanloads? What is to be\\r\\ndone now? You are late and I let number fourteen go in the night. What\\r\\nare we to do now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man discreetly takes hold of the fur of Malahin’s coat with\\r\\ntwo pink fingers and, shifting from one foot to the other, explains\\r\\naffably and convincingly that such and such numbers have gone already,\\r\\nand that such and such are going, and that he is ready to do for Malahin\\r\\neverything in his power. And from his face it is evident that he is\\r\\nready to do anything to please not only Malahin, but the whole world--he\\r\\nis so happy, so pleased, and so delighted! The old man listens, and\\r\\nthough he can make absolutely nothing of the intricate system of\\r\\nnumbering the trains, he nods his head approvingly, and he, too, puts\\r\\ntwo fingers on the soft wool of the rough coat. He enjoys seeing and\\r\\nhearing the polite and genial young man. To show goodwill on his side\\r\\nalso, he takes out a ten-rouble note and, after a moment’s thought, adds\\r\\na couple of rouble notes to it, and gives them to the station-master.\\r\\nThe latter takes them, puts his finger to his cap, and gracefully\\r\\nthrusts them into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, gentlemen, can’t we arrange it like this?” he says, kindled by a\\r\\nnew idea that has flashed on him. “The troop train is late,... as you\\r\\nsee, it is not here,... so why shouldn’t you go as the troop train?**\\r\\nAnd I will let the troop train go as twenty-eight. Eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you like,” agrees the guard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” the station-master says, delighted. “In that case there is\\r\\nno need for you to wait here; you can set off at once. I’ll dispatch you\\r\\nimmediately. Excellent!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe salutes Malahin and runs off to his room, reading forms as he goes.\\r\\nThe old man is very much pleased by the conversation that has just\\r\\ntaken place; he smiles and looks about the room as though looking for\\r\\nsomething else agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll have a drink, though,” he says, taking the guard’s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems a little early for drinking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you must let me treat you to a glass in a friendly way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both go to the refreshment bar. After having a drink the guard\\r\\nspends a long time selecting something to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a very stout, elderly man, with a puffy and discolored face. His\\r\\nfatness is unpleasant, flabby-looking, and he is sallow as people are\\r\\nwho drink too much and sleep irregularly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now we might have a second glass,” says Malahin. “It’s cold now,\\r\\nit’s no sin to drink. Please take some. So I can rely upon you, Mr.\\r\\nGuard, that there will be no hindrance or unpleasantness for the rest\\r\\nof the journey. For you know in moving cattle every hour is precious.\\r\\nTo-day meat is one price; and to-morrow, look you, it will be another.\\r\\nIf you are a day or two late and don’t get your price, instead of a\\r\\nprofit you get home--excuse my saying it--without your breeches. Pray\\r\\ntake a little.... I rely on you, and as for standing you something or\\r\\nwhat you like, I shall be pleased to show you my respect at any time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having fed the guard, Malahin goes back to the van.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have just got hold of the troop train,” he says to his son. “We shall\\r\\ngo quickly. The guard says if we go all the way with that number we\\r\\nshall arrive at eight o’clock to-morrow evening. If one does not bestir\\r\\noneself, my boy, one gets nothing.... That’s so.... So you watch\\r\\nand learn....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first bell a man with a face black with soot, in a blouse and\\r\\nfilthy frayed trousers hanging very slack, comes to the door of the van.\\r\\nThis is the oiler, who had been creeping under the carriages and tapping\\r\\nthe wheels with a hammer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are these your vans of cattle?” he asks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, because two of the vans are not safe. They can’t go on, they must\\r\\nstay here to be repaired.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come, tell us another! You simply want a drink, to get something\\r\\nout of me.... You should have said so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you please, only it is my duty to report it at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout indignation or protest, simply, almost mechanically, the old man\\r\\ntakes two twenty-kopeck pieces out of his pocket and gives them to the\\r\\noiler. He takes them very calmly, too, and looking good-naturedly at the\\r\\nold man enters into conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are going to sell your cattle, I suppose.... It’s good\\r\\nbusiness!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMalahin sighs and, looking calmly at the oiler’s black face, tells him\\r\\nthat trading in cattle used certainly to be profitable, but now it has\\r\\nbecome a risky and losing business.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have a mate here,” the oiler interrupts him. “You merchant gentlemen\\r\\nmight make him a little present....”\\r\\n\\r\\nMalahin gives something to the mate too. The troop train goes quickly\\r\\nand the waits at the stations are comparatively short. The old man is\\r\\npleased. The pleasant impression made by the young man in the rough\\r\\novercoat has gone deep, the vodka he has drunk slightly clouds his\\r\\nbrain, the weather is magnificent, and everything seems to be going\\r\\nwell. He talks without ceasing, and at every stopping place runs to the\\r\\nrefreshment bar. Feeling the need of a listener, he takes with him first\\r\\nthe guard, and then the engine-driver, and does not simply drink, but\\r\\nmakes a long business of it, with suitable remarks and clinking of\\r\\nglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have your job and we have ours,” he says with an affable smile.\\r\\n“May God prosper us and you, and not our will but His be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vodka gradually excites him and he is worked up to a great pitch of\\r\\nenergy. He wants to bestir himself, to fuss about, to make inquiries,\\r\\nto talk incessantly. At one minute he fumbles in his pockets and bundles\\r\\nand looks for some form. Then he thinks of something and cannot remember\\r\\nit; then takes out his pocketbook, and with no sort of object counts\\r\\nover his money. He bustles about, sighs and groans, clasps his hands....\\r\\nLaying out before him the letters and telegrams from the meat\\r\\nsalesmen in the city, bills, post office and telegraphic receipt forms,\\r\\nand his note book, he reflects aloud and insists on Yasha’s listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he is tired of reading over forms and talking about prices, he\\r\\ngets out at the stopping places, runs to the vans where his cattle are,\\r\\ndoes nothing, but simply clasps his hands and exclaims in horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear! oh, dear!” he says in a complaining voice. “Holy Martyr\\r\\nVlassy! Though they are bullocks, though they are beasts, yet they want\\r\\nto eat and drink as men do.... It’s four days and nights since they\\r\\nhave drunk or eaten. Oh, dear! oh, dear!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYasha follows him and does what he is told like an obedient son. He does\\r\\nnot like the old man’s frequent visits to the refreshment bar. Though he\\r\\nis afraid of his father, he cannot refrain from remarking on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you have begun already!” he says, looking sternly at the old man.\\r\\n“What are you rejoicing at? Is it your name-day or what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you dare teach your father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fine goings on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he has not to follow his father along the other vans Yasha sits on\\r\\nthe cape and strums on the accordion. Occasionally he gets out and walks\\r\\nlazily beside the train; he stands by the engine and turns a prolonged,\\r\\nunmoving stare on the wheels or on the workmen tossing blocks of wood\\r\\ninto the tender; the hot engine wheezes, the falling blocks come down\\r\\nwith the mellow, hearty thud of fresh wood; the engine-driver and\\r\\nhis assistant, very phlegmatic and imperturbable persons, perform\\r\\nincomprehensible movements and don’t hurry themselves. After standing\\r\\nfor a while by the engine, Yasha saunters lazily to the station; here\\r\\nhe looks at the eatables in the refreshment bar, reads aloud some quite\\r\\nuninteresting notice, and goes back slowly to the cattle van. His face\\r\\nexpresses neither boredom nor desire; apparently he does not care where\\r\\nhe is, at home, in the van, or by the engine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening the train stops near a big station. The lamps have only\\r\\njust been lighted along the line; against the blue background in the\\r\\nfresh limpid air the lights are bright and pale like stars; they are\\r\\nonly red and glowing under the station roof, where it is already dark.\\r\\nAll the lines are loaded up with carriages, and it seems that if another\\r\\ntrain came in there would be no place for it. Yasha runs to the station\\r\\nfor boiling water to make the evening tea. Well-dressed ladies and\\r\\nhigh-school boys are walking on the platform. If one looks into the\\r\\ndistance from the platform there are far-away lights twinkling in the\\r\\nevening dusk on both sides of the station--that is the town. What town?\\r\\nYasha does not care to know. He sees only the dim lights and wretched\\r\\nbuildings beyond the station, hears the cabmen shouting, feels a\\r\\nsharp, cold wind on his face, and imagines that the town is probably\\r\\ndisagreeable, uncomfortable, and dull.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they are having tea, when it is quite dark and a lantern is\\r\\nhanging on the wall again as on the previous evening, the train quivers\\r\\nfrom a slight shock and begins moving backwards. After going a little\\r\\nway it stops; they hear indistinct shouts, someone sets the chains\\r\\nclanking near the buffers and shouts, “Ready!” The train moves and goes\\r\\nforward. Ten minutes later it is dragged back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting out of the van, Malahin does not recognize his train. His eight\\r\\nvans of bullocks are standing in the same row with some trolleys which\\r\\nwere not a part of the train before. Two or three of these are loaded\\r\\nwith rubble and the others are empty. The guards running to and fro on\\r\\nthe platform are strangers. They give unwilling and indistinct answers\\r\\nto his questions. They have no thoughts to spare for Malahin; they are\\r\\nin a hurry to get the train together so as to finish as soon as possible\\r\\nand be back in the warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What number is this?” asks Malahin\\r\\n\\r\\n“Number eighteen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where is the troop train? Why have you taken me off the troop\\r\\ntrain?”\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting no answer, the old man goes to the station. He looks first for\\r\\nthe familiar figure of the head guard and, not finding him, goes to\\r\\nthe station-master. The station-master is sitting at a table in his own\\r\\nroom, turning over a bundle of forms. He is busy, and affects not to\\r\\nsee the newcomer. His appearance is impressive: a cropped black head,\\r\\nprominent ears, a long hooked nose, a swarthy face; he has a forbidding\\r\\nand, as it were, offended expression. Malahin begins making his\\r\\ncomplaint at great length.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” queries the station-master. “How is this?” He leans against the\\r\\nback of his chair and goes on, growing indignant: “What is it? and\\r\\nwhy shouldn’t you go by number eighteen? Speak more clearly, I don’t\\r\\nunderstand! How is it? Do you want me to be everywhere at once?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe showers questions on him, and for no apparent reason grows\\r\\nsterner and sterner. Malahin is already feeling in his pocket for his\\r\\npocketbook, but in the end the station-master, aggrieved and indignant,\\r\\nfor some unknown reason jumps up from his seat and runs out of the room.\\r\\nMalahin shrugs his shoulders, and goes out to look for someone else to\\r\\nspeak to.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom boredom or from a desire to put the finishing stroke to a busy day,\\r\\nor simply that a window with the inscription “Telegraph!” on it catches\\r\\nhis eye, he goes to the window and expresses a desire to send off a\\r\\ntelegram. Taking up a pen, he thinks for a moment, and writes on a blue\\r\\nform: “Urgent. Traffic Manager. Eight vans of live stock. Delayed at\\r\\nevery station. Kindly send an express number. Reply paid. Malahin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving sent off the telegram, he goes back to the station-master’s\\r\\nroom. There he finds, sitting on a sofa covered with gray cloth, a\\r\\nbenevolent-looking gentleman in spectacles and a cap of raccoon fur; he\\r\\nis wearing a peculiar overcoat very much like a lady’s, edged with fur,\\r\\nwith frogs and slashed sleeves. Another gentleman, dried-up and sinewy,\\r\\nwearing the uniform of a railway inspector, stands facing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just think of it,” says the inspector, addressing the gentleman in the\\r\\nqueer overcoat. “I’ll tell you an incident that really is A1! The Z.\\r\\nrailway line in the coolest possible way stole three hundred trucks\\r\\nfrom the N. line. It’s a fact, sir! I swear it! They carried them off,\\r\\nrepainted them, put their letters on them, and that’s all about it. The\\r\\nN. line sends its agents everywhere, they hunt and hunt. And then--can\\r\\nyou imagine it?--the Company happen to come upon a broken-down carriage\\r\\nof the Z. line. They repair it at their depot, and all at once, bless my\\r\\nsoul! see their own mark on the wheels What do you say to that? Eh? If\\r\\nI did it they would send me to Siberia, but the railway companies simply\\r\\nsnap their fingers at it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is pleasant to Malahin to talk to educated, cultured people. He\\r\\nstrokes his beard and joins in the conversation with dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take this case, gentlemen, for instance,” he says. “I am transporting\\r\\ncattle to X. Eight vanloads. Very good.... Now let us say they charge\\r\\nme for each vanload as a weight of ten tons; eight bullocks don’t weigh\\r\\nten tons, but much less, yet they don’t take any notice of that....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant Yasha walks into the room looking for his father. He\\r\\nlistens and is about to sit down on a chair, but probably thinking of\\r\\nhis weight goes and sits on the window-sill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They don’t take any notice of that,” Malahin goes on, “and charge me\\r\\nand my son the third-class fare, too, forty-two roubles, for going in\\r\\nthe van with the bullocks. This is my son Yakov. I have two more at\\r\\nhome, but they have gone in for study. Well and apart from that it is my\\r\\nopinion that the railways have ruined the cattle trade. In old days when\\r\\nthey drove them in herds it was better.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man’s talk is lengthy and drawn out. After every sentence he\\r\\nlooks at Yasha as though he would say: “See how I am talking to clever\\r\\npeople.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word!” the inspector interrupts him. “No one is indignant, no\\r\\none criticizes. And why? It is very simple. An abomination strikes\\r\\nthe eye and arouses indignation only when it is exceptional, when the\\r\\nestablished order is broken by it. Here, where, saving your presence, it\\r\\nconstitutes the long-established program and forms and enters into the\\r\\nbasis of the order itself, where every sleeper on the line bears the\\r\\ntrace of it and stinks of it, one too easily grows accustomed to it!\\r\\nYes, sir!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second bell rings, the gentlemen in the queer overcoat gets up. The\\r\\ninspector takes him by the arm and, still talking with heat, goes off\\r\\nwith him to the platform. After the third bell the station-master runs\\r\\ninto his room, and sits down at his table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, with what number am I to go?” asks Malahin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master looks at a form and says indignantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you Malahin, eight vanloads? You must pay a rouble a van and\\r\\nsix roubles and twenty kopecks for stamps. You have no stamps. Total,\\r\\nfourteen roubles, twenty kopecks.”\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving the money, he writes something down, dries it with sand, and,\\r\\nhurriedly snatching up a bundle of forms, goes quickly out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ten o’clock in the evening Malahin gets an answer from the traffic\\r\\nmanager: “Give precedence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nReading the telegram through, the old man winks significantly and, very\\r\\nwell pleased with himself, puts it in his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here,” he says to Yasha, “look and learn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight his train goes on. The night is dark and cold like the\\r\\nprevious one; the waits at the stations are long. Yasha sits on the cape\\r\\nand imperturbably strums on the accordion, while the old man is still\\r\\nmore eager to exert himself. At one of the stations he is overtaken by\\r\\na desire to lodge a complaint. At his request a gendarme sits down and\\r\\nwrites:\\r\\n\\r\\n“November 10, 188-.--I, non-commissioned officer of the Z. section of\\r\\nthe N. police department of railways, Ilya Tchered, in accordance with\\r\\narticle II of the statute of May 19, 1871, have drawn up this protocol\\r\\nat the station of X. as herewith follows.... ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I to write next?” asks the gendarme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalahin lays out before him forms, postal and telegraph receipts,\\r\\naccounts.... He does not know himself definitely what he wants of the\\r\\ngendarme; he wants to describe in the protocol not any separate episode\\r\\nbut his whole journey, with all his losses and conversations with\\r\\nstation-masters--to describe it lengthily and vindictively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the station of Z.,” he says, “write that the station-master unlinked\\r\\nmy vans from the troop train because he did not like my countenance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he wants the gendarme to be sure to mention his countenance. The\\r\\nlatter listens wearily, and goes on writing without hearing him to the\\r\\nend. He ends his protocol thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The above deposition I, non-commissioned officer Tchered, have written\\r\\ndown in this protocol with a view to present it to the head of the Z.\\r\\nsection, and have handed a copy thereof to Gavril Malahin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man takes the copy, adds it to the papers with which his side\\r\\npocket is stuffed, and, much pleased, goes back to his van.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Malahin wakes up again in a bad humor, but his wrath\\r\\nvents itself not on Yasha but the cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The cattle are done for!” he grumbles. “They are done for! They are at\\r\\nthe last gasp! God be my judge! they will all die. Tfoo!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bullocks, who have had nothing to drink for many days, tortured by\\r\\nthirst, are licking the hoar frost on the walls, and when Malachin goes\\r\\nup to them they begin licking his cold fur jacket. From their clear,\\r\\ntearful eyes it can be seen that they are exhausted by thirst and the\\r\\njolting of the train, that they are hungry and miserable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a nice job taking you by rail, you wretched brutes!” mutters\\r\\nMalahin. “I could wish you were dead to get it over! It makes me sick to\\r\\nlook at you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midday the train stops at a big station where, according to the\\r\\nregulations, there was drinking water provided for cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater is given to the cattle, but the bullocks will not drink it: the\\r\\nwater is too cold....\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * * *\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo more days and nights pass, and at last in the distance in the murky\\r\\nfog the city comes into sight. The journey is over. The train comes\\r\\nto a standstill before reaching the town, near a goods’ station. The\\r\\nbullocks, released from the van, stagger and stumble as though they were\\r\\nwalking on slippery ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving got through the unloading and veterinary inspection, Malahin and\\r\\nYasha take up their quarters in a dirty, cheap hotel in the outskirts\\r\\nof the town, in the square in which the cattle-market is held. Their\\r\\nlodgings are filthy and their food is disgusting, unlike what they\\r\\never have at home; they sleep to the harsh strains of a wretched steam\\r\\nhurdy-gurdy which plays day and night in the restaurant under their\\r\\nlodging.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man spends his time from morning till night going about looking\\r\\nfor purchasers, and Yasha sits for days in the hotel room, or goes out\\r\\ninto the street to look at the town. He sees the filthy square heaped\\r\\nup with dung, the signboards of restaurants, the turreted walls of a\\r\\nmonastery in the fog. Sometimes he runs across the street and looks into\\r\\nthe grocer’s shop, admires the jars of cakes of different colors, yawns,\\r\\nand lazily saunters back to his room. The city does not interest him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the bullocks are sold to a dealer. Malahin hires drovers. The\\r\\ncattle are divided into herds, ten in each, and driven to the other end\\r\\nof the town. The bullocks, exhausted, go with drooping heads through the\\r\\nnoisy streets, and look indifferently at what they see for the first and\\r\\nlast time in their lives. The tattered drovers walk after them, their\\r\\nheads drooping too. They are bored.... Now and then some drover\\r\\nstarts out of his brooding, remembers that there are cattle in front\\r\\nof him intrusted to his charge, and to show that he is doing his duty\\r\\nbrings a stick down full swing on a bullock’s back. The bullock staggers\\r\\nwith the pain, runs forward a dozen paces, and looks about him as though\\r\\nhe were ashamed at being beaten before people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter selling the bullocks and buying for his family presents such as\\r\\nthey could perfectly well have bought at home, Malahin and Yasha get\\r\\nready for their journey back. Three hours before the train goes the old\\r\\nman, who has already had a drop too much with the purchaser and so is\\r\\nfussy, goes down with Yasha to the restaurant and sits down to drink\\r\\ntea. Like all provincials, he cannot eat and drink alone: he must have\\r\\ncompany as fussy and as fond of sedate conversation as himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call the host!” he says to the waiter; “tell him I should like to\\r\\nentertain him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotel-keeper, a well-fed man, absolutely indifferent to his lodgers,\\r\\ncomes and sits down to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we have sold our stock,” Malahin says, laughing. “I have swapped\\r\\nmy goat for a hawk. Why, when we set off the price of meat was three\\r\\nroubles ninety kopecks, but when we arrived it had dropped to three\\r\\nroubles twenty-five. They tell us we are too late, we should have been\\r\\nhere three days earlier, for now there is not the same demand for meat,\\r\\nSt. Philip’s fast has come.... Eh? It’s a nice how-do-you-do! It\\r\\nmeant a loss of fourteen roubles on each bullock. Yes. But only think\\r\\nwhat it costs to bring the stock! Fifteen roubles carriage, and you must\\r\\nput down six roubles for each bullock, tips, bribes, drinks, and one\\r\\nthing and another....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotel-keeper listens out of politeness and reluctantly drinks tea.\\r\\nMalahin sighs and groans, gesticulates, jests about his ill-luck, but\\r\\neverything shows that the loss he has sustained does not trouble him\\r\\nmuch. He doesn’t mind whether he has lost or gained as long as he has\\r\\nlisteners, has something to make a fuss about, and is not late for his\\r\\ntrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later Malahin and Yasha, laden with bags and boxes, go\\r\\ndownstairs from the hotel room to the front door to get into a sledge\\r\\nand drive to the station. They are seen off by the hotel-keeper, the\\r\\nwaiter, and various women. The old man is touched. He thrusts ten-kopeck\\r\\npieces in all directions, and says in a sing-song voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good by, good health to you! God grant that all may be well with\\r\\nyou. Please God if we are alive and well we shall come again in Lent.\\r\\nGood-by. Thank you. God bless you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting into the sledge, the old man spends a long time crossing himself\\r\\nin the direction in which the monastery walls make a patch of darkness\\r\\nin the fog. Yasha sits beside him on the very edge of the seat with his\\r\\nlegs hanging over the side. His face as before shows no sign of emotion\\r\\nand expresses neither boredom nor desire. He is not glad that he is\\r\\ngoing home, nor sorry that he has not had time to see the sights of the\\r\\ncity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Drive on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cabman whips up the horse and, turning round, begins swearing at the\\r\\nheavy and cumbersome luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * On many railway lines, in order to avoid accidents, it is\\r\\n     against the regulations to carry hay on the trains, and so\\r\\n     live stock are without fodder on the journey.--Author’s\\r\\n     Note.\\r\\n\\r\\n     **The train destined especially for the transport of troops\\r\\n     is called the troop train; when there are no troops it takes\\r\\n     goods, and goes more rapidly than ordinary goods train.\\r\\n     --Author’s Note.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSORROW\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE turner, Grigory Petrov, who had been known for years past as a\\r\\nsplendid craftsman, and at the same time as the most senseless peasant\\r\\nin the Galtchinskoy district, was taking his old woman to the hospital.\\r\\nHe had to drive over twenty miles, and it was an awful road. A\\r\\ngovernment post driver could hardly have coped with it, much less an\\r\\nincompetent sluggard like Grigory. A cutting cold wind was blowing\\r\\nstraight in his face. Clouds of snowflakes were whirling round and\\r\\nround in all directions, so that one could not tell whether the snow was\\r\\nfalling from the sky or rising from the earth. The fields, the telegraph\\r\\nposts, and the forest could not be seen for the fog of snow. And when a\\r\\nparticularly violent gust of wind swooped down on Grigory, even the yoke\\r\\nabove the horse’s head could not be seen. The wretched, feeble little\\r\\nnag crawled slowly along. It took all its strength to drag its legs out\\r\\nof the snow and to tug with its head. The turner was in a hurry. He kept\\r\\nrestlessly hopping up and down on the front seat and lashing the horse’s\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t cry, Matryona,...” he muttered. “Have a little patience.\\r\\nPlease God we shall reach the hospital, and in a trice it will be the\\r\\nright thing for you.... Pavel Ivanitch will give you some little\\r\\ndrops, or tell them to bleed you; or maybe his honor will be pleased to\\r\\nrub you with some sort of spirit--it’ll... draw it out of your side.\\r\\nPavel Ivanitch will do his best. He will shout and stamp about, but he\\r\\nwill do his best.... He is a nice gentleman, affable, God give him\\r\\nhealth! As soon as we get there he will dart out of his room and will\\r\\nbegin calling me names. ‘How? Why so?’ he will cry. ‘Why did you not\\r\\ncome at the right time? I am not a dog to be hanging about waiting on\\r\\nyou devils all day. Why did you not come in the morning? Go away! Get\\r\\nout of my sight. Come again to-morrow.’ And I shall say: ‘Mr. Doctor!\\r\\nPavel Ivanitch! Your honor!’ Get on, do! plague take you, you devil! Get\\r\\non!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turner lashed his nag, and without looking at the old woman went on\\r\\nmuttering to himself:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Your honor! It’s true as before God.... Here’s the Cross for you,\\r\\nI set off almost before it was light. How could I be here in time if\\r\\nthe Lord.... The Mother of God... is wroth, and has sent such a\\r\\nsnowstorm? Kindly look for yourself.... Even a first-rate horse could\\r\\nnot do it, while mine--you can see for yourself--is not a horse but a\\r\\ndisgrace.’ And Pavel Ivanitch will frown and shout: ‘We know you! You\\r\\nalways find some excuse! Especially you, Grishka; I know you of old!\\r\\nI’ll be bound you have stopped at half a dozen taverns!’ And I shall\\r\\nsay: ‘Your honor! am I a criminal or a heathen? My old woman is giving\\r\\nup her soul to God, she is dying, and am I going to run from tavern to\\r\\ntavern! What an idea, upon my word! Plague take them, the taverns!’ Then\\r\\nPavel Ivanitch will order you to be taken into the hospital, and I shall\\r\\nfall at his feet.... ‘Pavel Ivanitch! Your honor, we thank you most\\r\\nhumbly! Forgive us fools and anathemas, don’t be hard on us peasants! We\\r\\ndeserve a good kicking, while you graciously put yourself out and mess\\r\\nyour feet in the snow!’ And Pavel Ivanitch will give me a look as\\r\\nthough he would like to hit me, and will say: ‘You’d much better not be\\r\\nswilling vodka, you fool, but taking pity on your old woman instead\\r\\nof falling at my feet. You want a thrashing!’ ‘You are right there--a\\r\\nthrashing, Pavel Ivanitch, strike me God! But how can we help bowing\\r\\ndown at your feet if you are our benefactor, and a real father to us?\\r\\nYour honor! I give you my word,... here as before God,... you\\r\\nmay spit in my face if I deceive you: as soon as my Matryona, this same\\r\\nhere, is well again and restored to her natural condition, I’ll make\\r\\nanything for your honor that you would like to order! A cigarette-case,\\r\\nif you like, of the best birchwood,... balls for croquet, skittles of\\r\\nthe most foreign pattern I can turn.... I will make anything for you!\\r\\nI won’t take a farthing from you. In Moscow they would charge you four\\r\\nroubles for such a cigarette-case, but I won’t take a farthing.’ The\\r\\ndoctor will laugh and say: ‘Oh, all right, all right.... I see! But\\r\\nit’s a pity you are a drunkard....’ I know how to manage the gentry,\\r\\nold girl. There isn’t a gentleman I couldn’t talk to. Only God grant we\\r\\ndon’t get off the road. Oh, how it is blowing! One’s eyes are full of\\r\\nsnow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the turner went on muttering endlessly. He prattled on mechanically\\r\\nto get a little relief from his depressing feelings. He had plenty of\\r\\nwords on his tongue, but the thoughts and questions in his brain\\r\\nwere even more numerous. Sorrow had come upon the turner unawares,\\r\\nunlooked-for, and unexpected, and now he could not get over it, could\\r\\nnot recover himself. He had lived hitherto in unruffled calm, as though\\r\\nin drunken half-consciousness, knowing neither grief nor joy, and now he\\r\\nwas suddenly aware of a dreadful pain in his heart. The careless idler\\r\\nand drunkard found himself quite suddenly in the position of a busy man,\\r\\nweighed down by anxieties and haste, and even struggling with nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turner remembered that his trouble had begun the evening before.\\r\\nWhen he had come home yesterday evening, a little drunk as usual, and\\r\\nfrom long-established habit had begun swearing and shaking his fists,\\r\\nhis old woman had looked at her rowdy spouse as she had never looked\\r\\nat him before. Usually, the expression in her aged eyes was that of a\\r\\nmartyr, meek like that of a dog frequently beaten and badly fed; this\\r\\ntime she had looked at him sternly and immovably, as saints in the holy\\r\\npictures or dying people look. From that strange, evil look in her eyes\\r\\nthe trouble had begun. The turner, stupefied with amazement, borrowed a\\r\\nhorse from a neighbor, and now was taking his old woman to the hospital\\r\\nin the hope that, by means of powders and ointments, Pavel Ivanitch\\r\\nwould bring back his old woman’s habitual expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, Matryona,...” the turner muttered, “if Pavel Ivanitch asks\\r\\nyou whether I beat you, say, ‘Never!’ and I never will beat you again. I\\r\\nswear it. And did I ever beat you out of spite? I just beat you without\\r\\nthinking. I am sorry for you. Some men wouldn’t trouble, but here I am\\r\\ntaking you.... I am doing my best. And the way it snows, the way it\\r\\nsnows! Thy Will be done, O Lord! God grant we don’t get off the road....\\r\\nDoes your side ache, Matryona, that you don’t speak? I ask you,\\r\\ndoes your side ache?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck him as strange that the snow on his old woman’s face was not\\r\\nmelting; it was queer that the face itself looked somehow drawn, and had\\r\\nturned a pale gray, dingy waxen hue and had grown grave and solemn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a fool!” muttered the turner.... “I tell you on my\\r\\nconscience, before God,... and you go and... Well, you are a fool!\\r\\nI have a good mind not to take you to Pavel Ivanitch!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turner let the reins go and began thinking. He could not bring\\r\\nhimself to look round at his old woman: he was frightened. He was\\r\\nafraid, too, of asking her a question and not getting an answer. At\\r\\nlast, to make an end of uncertainty, without looking round he felt his\\r\\nold woman’s cold hand. The lifted hand fell like a log.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is dead, then! What a business!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the turner cried. He was not so much sorry as annoyed. He thought\\r\\nhow quickly everything passes in this world! His trouble had hardly\\r\\nbegun when the final catastrophe had happened. He had not had time to\\r\\nlive with his old woman, to show her he was sorry for her before she\\r\\ndied. He had lived with her for forty years, but those forty years had\\r\\npassed by as it were in a fog. What with drunkenness, quarreling, and\\r\\npoverty, there had been no feeling of life. And, as though to spite him,\\r\\nhis old woman died at the very time when he felt he was sorry for her,\\r\\nthat he could not live without her, and that he had behaved dreadfully\\r\\nbadly to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, she used to go the round of the village,” he remembered. “I sent\\r\\nher out myself to beg for bread. What a business! She ought to have\\r\\nlived another ten years, the silly thing; as it is I’ll be bound she\\r\\nthinks I really was that sort of man.... Holy Mother! but where the\\r\\ndevil am I driving? There’s no need for a doctor now, but a burial. Turn\\r\\nback!”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrigory turned back and lashed the horse with all his might. The road\\r\\ngrew worse and worse every hour. Now he could not see the yoke at\\r\\nall. Now and then the sledge ran into a young fir tree, a dark object\\r\\nscratched the turner’s hands and flashed before his eyes, and the field\\r\\nof vision was white and whirling again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To live over again,” thought the turner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remembered that forty years ago Matryona had been young, handsome,\\r\\nmerry, that she had come of a well-to-do family. They had married her\\r\\nto him because they had been attracted by his handicraft. All the\\r\\nessentials for a happy life had been there, but the trouble was that,\\r\\njust as he had got drunk after the wedding and lay sprawling on the\\r\\nstove, so he had gone on without waking up till now. His wedding he\\r\\nremembered, but of what happened after the wedding--for the life of him\\r\\nhe could remember nothing, except perhaps that he had drunk, lain on the\\r\\nstove, and quarreled. Forty years had been wasted like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white clouds of snow were beginning little by little to turn gray.\\r\\nIt was getting dusk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where am I going?” the turner suddenly bethought him with a start.\\r\\n“I ought to be thinking of the burial, and I am on the way to the\\r\\nhospital.... It as is though I had gone crazy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrigory turned round again, and again lashed his horse. The little nag\\r\\nstrained its utmost and, with a snort, fell into a little trot. The\\r\\nturner lashed it on the back time after time.... A knocking was\\r\\naudible behind him, and though he did not look round, he knew it was the\\r\\ndead woman’s head knocking against the sledge. And the snow kept turning\\r\\ndarker and darker, the wind grew colder and more cutting....\\r\\n\\r\\n“To live over again!” thought the turner. “I should get a new lathe,\\r\\ntake orders,... give the money to my old woman....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he dropped the reins. He looked for them, tried to pick them\\r\\nup, but could not--his hands would not work....\\r\\n\\r\\n“It does not matter,” he thought, “the horse will go of itself, it knows\\r\\nthe way. I might have a little sleep now.... Before the funeral or\\r\\nthe requiem it would be as well to get a little rest....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turner closed his eyes and dozed. A little later he heard the horse\\r\\nstop; he opened his eyes and saw before him something dark like a hut or\\r\\na haystack....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would have got out of the sledge and found out what it was, but he\\r\\nfelt overcome by such inertia that it seemed better to freeze than move,\\r\\nand he sank into a peaceful sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe woke up in a big room with painted walls. Bright sunlight was\\r\\nstreaming in at the windows. The turner saw people facing him, and his\\r\\nfirst feeling was a desire to show himself a respectable man who knew\\r\\nhow things should be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A requiem, brothers, for my old woman,” he said. “The priest should be\\r\\ntold....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, all right, all right; lie down,” a voice cut him short.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pavel Ivanitch!” the turner cried in surprise, seeing the doctor before\\r\\nhim. “Your honor, benefactor!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wanted to leap up and fall on his knees before the doctor, but felt\\r\\nthat his arms and legs would not obey him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor, where are my legs, where are my arms!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say good-by to your arms and legs.... They’ve been frozen off. Come,\\r\\ncome!... What are you crying for? You’ve lived your life, and thank\\r\\nGod for it! I suppose you have had sixty years of it--that’s enough for\\r\\nyou!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am grieving.... Graciously forgive me! If I could have another\\r\\nfive or six years!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The horse isn’t mine, I must give it back.... I must bury my old\\r\\nwoman.... How quickly it is all ended in this world! Your honor,\\r\\nPavel Ivanitch! A cigarette-case of birchwood of the best! I’ll turn you\\r\\ncroquet balls....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor went out of the ward with a wave of his hand. It was all over\\r\\nwith the turner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON OFFICIAL DUTY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE deputy examining magistrate and the district doctor were going to an\\r\\ninquest in the village of Syrnya. On the road they were overtaken by a\\r\\nsnowstorm; they spent a long time going round and round, and arrived,\\r\\nnot at midday, as they had intended, but in the evening when it was\\r\\ndark. They put up for the night at the Zemstvo hut. It so happened\\r\\nthat it was in this hut that the dead body was lying--the corpse of the\\r\\nZemstvo insurance agent, Lesnitsky, who had arrived in Syrnya three days\\r\\nbefore and, ordering the samovar in the hut, had shot himself, to the\\r\\ngreat surprise of everyone; and the fact that he had ended his life\\r\\nso strangely, after unpacking his eatables and laying them out on the\\r\\ntable, and with the samovar before him, led many people to suspect that\\r\\nit was a case of murder; an inquest was necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the outer room the doctor and the examining magistrate shook the snow\\r\\noff themselves and knocked it off their boots. And meanwhile the old\\r\\nvillage constable, Ilya Loshadin, stood by, holding a little tin lamp.\\r\\nThere was a strong smell of paraffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?” asked the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Conshtable,...” answered the constable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used to spell it “conshtable” when he signed the receipts at the post\\r\\noffice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where are the witnesses?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They must have gone to tea, your honor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the right was the parlor, the travelers’ or gentry’s room; on the\\r\\nleft the kitchen, with a big stove and sleeping shelves under the\\r\\nrafters. The doctor and the examining magistrate, followed by the\\r\\nconstable, holding the lamp high above his head, went into the parlor.\\r\\nHere a still, long body covered with white linen was lying on the floor\\r\\nclose to the table-legs. In the dim light of the lamp they could clearly\\r\\nsee, besides the white covering, new rubber goloshes, and everything\\r\\nabout it was uncanny and sinister: the dark walls, and the silence, and\\r\\nthe goloshes, and the stillness of the dead body. On the table stood a\\r\\nsamovar, cold long ago; and round it parcels, probably the eatables.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To shoot oneself in the Zemstvo hut, how tactless!” said the doctor.\\r\\n“If one does want to put a bullet through one’s brains, one ought to do\\r\\nit at home in some outhouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sank on to a bench, just as he was, in his cap, his fur coat, and his\\r\\nfelt overboots; his fellow-traveler, the examining magistrate, sat down\\r\\nopposite.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These hysterical, neurasthenic people are great egoists,” the doctor\\r\\nwent on hotly. “If a neurasthenic sleeps in the same room with you, he\\r\\nrustles his newspaper; when he dines with you, he gets up a scene\\r\\nwith his wife without troubling about your presence; and when he feels\\r\\ninclined to shoot himself, he shoots himself in a village in a Zemstvo\\r\\nhut, so as to give the maximum of trouble to everybody. These gentlemen\\r\\nin every circumstance of life think of no one but themselves! That’s why\\r\\nthe elderly so dislike our ‘nervous age.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The elderly dislike so many things,” said the examining magistrate,\\r\\nyawning. “You should point out to the elder generation what the\\r\\ndifference is between the suicides of the past and the suicides of\\r\\nto-day. In the old days the so-called gentleman shot himself because he\\r\\nhad made away with Government money, but nowadays it is because he is\\r\\nsick of life, depressed.... Which is better?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sick of life, depressed; but you must admit that he might have shot\\r\\nhimself somewhere else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such trouble!” said the constable, “such trouble! It’s a real\\r\\naffliction. The people are very much upset, your honor; they haven’t\\r\\nslept these three nights. The children are crying. The cows ought to be\\r\\nmilked, but the women won’t go to the stall--they are afraid... for\\r\\nfear the gentleman should appear to them in the darkness. Of course they\\r\\nare silly women, but some of the men are frightened too. As soon as\\r\\nit is dark they won’t go by the hut one by one, but only in a flock\\r\\ntogether. And the witnesses too....”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Startchenko, a middle-aged man in spectacles with a dark beard, and\\r\\nthe examining magistrate Lyzhin, a fair man, still young, who had only\\r\\ntaken his degree two years before and looked more like a student than an\\r\\nofficial, sat in silence, musing. They were vexed that they were late.\\r\\nNow they had to wait till morning, and to stay here for the night,\\r\\nthough it was not yet six o’clock; and they had before them a long\\r\\nevening, a dark night, boredom, uncomfortable beds, beetles, and cold\\r\\nin the morning; and listening to the blizzard that howled in the chimney\\r\\nand in the loft, they both thought how unlike all this was the life\\r\\nwhich they would have chosen for themselves and of which they had once\\r\\ndreamed, and how far away they both were from their contemporaries, who\\r\\nwere at that moment walking about the lighted streets in town without\\r\\nnoticing the weather, or were getting ready for the theatre, or sitting\\r\\nin their studies over a book. Oh, how much they would have given now\\r\\nonly to stroll along the Nevsky Prospect, or along Petrovka in Moscow,\\r\\nto listen to decent singing, to sit for an hour or so in a restaurant!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oo-oo-oo-oo!” sang the storm in the loft, and something outside slammed\\r\\nviciously, probably the signboard on the hut. “Oo-oo-oo-oo!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can do as you please, but I have no desire to stay here,” said\\r\\nStartchenko, getting up. “It’s not six yet, it’s too early to go to bed;\\r\\nI am off. Von Taunitz lives not far from here, only a couple of\\r\\nmiles from Syrnya. I shall go to see him and spend the evening there.\\r\\nConstable, run and tell my coachman not to take the horses out. And what\\r\\nare you going to do?” he asked Lyzhin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know; I expect I shall go to sleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor wrapped himself in his fur coat and went out. Lyzhin could\\r\\nhear him talking to the coachman and the bells beginning to quiver on\\r\\nthe frozen horses. He drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not nice for you, sir, to spend the night in here,” said the\\r\\nconstable; “come into the other room. It’s dirty, but for one night it\\r\\nwon’t matter. I’ll get a samovar from a peasant and heat it directly.\\r\\nI’ll heap up some hay for you, and then you go to sleep, and God bless\\r\\nyou, your honor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA little later the examining magistrate was sitting in the kitchen\\r\\ndrinking tea, while Loshadin, the constable, was standing at the door\\r\\ntalking. He was an old man about sixty, short and very thin, bent and\\r\\nwhite, with a naive smile on his face and watery eyes, and he kept\\r\\nsmacking with his lips as though he were sucking a sweetmeat. He was\\r\\nwearing a short sheepskin coat and high felt boots, and held his stick\\r\\nin his hands all the time. The youth of the examining magistrate aroused\\r\\nhis compassion, and that was probably why he addressed him familiarly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The elder gave orders that he was to be informed when the police\\r\\nsuperintendent or the examining magistrate came,” he said, “so I suppose\\r\\nI must go now.... It’s nearly three miles to the _volost_, and the\\r\\nstorm, the snowdrifts, are something terrible--maybe one won’t get there\\r\\nbefore midnight. Ough! how the wind roars!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t need the elder,” said Lyzhin. “There is nothing for him to do\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at the old man with curiosity, and asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, grandfather, how many years have you been constable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How many? Why, thirty years. Five years after the Freedom I began going\\r\\nas constable, that’s how I reckon it. And from that time I have been\\r\\ngoing every day since. Other people have holidays, but I am always\\r\\ngoing. When it’s Easter and the church bells are ringing and Christ has\\r\\nrisen, I still go about with my bag--to the treasury, to the post, to\\r\\nthe police superintendent’s lodgings, to the rural captain, to the tax\\r\\ninspector, to the municipal office, to the gentry, to the peasants, to\\r\\nall orthodox Christians. I carry parcels, notices, tax papers, letters,\\r\\nforms of different sorts, circulars, and to be sure, kind gentleman,\\r\\nthere are all sorts of forms nowadays, so as to note down the\\r\\nnumbers--yellow, white, and red--and every gentleman or priest or\\r\\nwell-to-do peasant must write down a dozen times in the year how much\\r\\nhe has sown and harvested, how many quarters or poods he has of rye, how\\r\\nmany of oats, how many of hay, and what the weather’s like, you know,\\r\\nand insects, too, of all sorts. To be sure you can write what you like,\\r\\nit’s only a regulation, but one must go and give out the notices and\\r\\nthen go again and collect them. Here, for instance, there’s no need to\\r\\ncut open the gentleman; you know yourself it’s a silly thing, it’s only\\r\\ndirtying your hands, and here you have been put to trouble, your honor;\\r\\nyou have come because it’s the regulation; you can’t help it. For thirty\\r\\nyears I have been going round according to regulation. In the summer\\r\\nit is all right, it is warm and dry; but in winter and autumn it’s\\r\\nuncomfortable. At times I have been almost drowned and almost frozen; all\\r\\nsorts of things have happened--wicked people set on me in the forest and\\r\\ntook away my bag; I have been beaten, and I have been before a court of\\r\\nlaw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What were you accused of?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of fraud.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you see, Hrisanf Grigoryev, the clerk, sold the contractor some\\r\\nboards belonging to someone else--cheated him, in fact. I was mixed up\\r\\nin it. They sent me to the tavern for vodka; well, the clerk did not\\r\\nshare with me--did not even offer me a glass; but as through my poverty\\r\\nI was--in appearance, I mean--not a man to be relied upon, not a man of\\r\\nany worth, we were both brought to trial; he was sent to prison, but,\\r\\npraise God! I was acquitted on all points. They read a notice, you know,\\r\\nin the court. And they were all in uniforms--in the court, I mean. I\\r\\ncan tell you, your honor, my duties for anyone not used to them are\\r\\nterrible, absolutely killing; but to me it is nothing. In fact, my feet\\r\\nache when I am not walking. And at home it is worse for me. At home one\\r\\nhas to heat the stove for the clerk in the _volost_ office, to fetch\\r\\nwater for him, to clean his boots.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what wages do you get?” Lyzhin asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eighty-four roubles a year.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll bet you get other little sums coming in. You do, don’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Other little sums? No, indeed! Gentlemen nowadays don’t often give\\r\\ntips. Gentlemen nowadays are strict, they take offense at anything.\\r\\nIf you bring them a notice they are offended, if you take off your cap\\r\\nbefore them they are offended. ‘You have come to the wrong entrance,’\\r\\nthey say. ‘You are a drunkard,’ they say. ‘You smell of onion; you are a\\r\\nblockhead; you are the son of a bitch.’ There are kind-hearted ones, of\\r\\ncourse; but what does one get from them? They only laugh and call one\\r\\nall sorts of names. Mr. Altuhin, for instance, he is a good-natured\\r\\ngentleman; and if you look at him he seems sober and in his right mind,\\r\\nbut so soon as he sees me he shouts and does not know what he means\\r\\nhimself. He gave me such a name ‘You,’ said he,...” The constable\\r\\nuttered some word, but in such a low voice that it was impossible to\\r\\nmake out what he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?” Lyzhin asked. “Say it again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Administration,’” the constable repeated aloud. “He has been\\r\\ncalling me that for a long while, for the last six years. ‘Hullo,\\r\\nAdministration!’ But I don’t mind; let him, God bless him! Sometimes a\\r\\nlady will send one a glass of vodka and a bit of pie and one drinks to\\r\\nher health. But peasants give more; peasants are more kind-hearted,\\r\\nthey have the fear of God in their hearts: one will give a bit of bread,\\r\\nanother a drop of cabbage soup, another will stand one a glass. The\\r\\nvillage elders treat one to tea in the tavern. Here the witnesses have\\r\\ngone to their tea. ‘Loshadin,’ they said, ‘you stay here and keep watch\\r\\nfor us,’ and they gave me a kopeck each. You see, they are frightened,\\r\\nnot being used to it, and yesterday they gave me fifteen kopecks and\\r\\noffered me a glass.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you, aren’t you frightened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am, sir; but of course it is my duty, there is no getting away from\\r\\nit. In the summer I was taking a convict to the town, and he set upon\\r\\nme and gave me such a drubbing! And all around were fields, forest--how\\r\\ncould I get away from him? It’s just the same here. I remember the\\r\\ngentleman, Mr. Lesnitsky, when he was so high, and I knew his father and\\r\\nmother. I am from the village of Nedoshtchotova, and they, the Lesnitsky\\r\\nfamily, were not more than three-quarters of a mile from us and less\\r\\nthan that, their ground next to ours, and Mr. Lesnitsky had a sister, a\\r\\nGod-fearing and tender-hearted lady. Lord keep the soul of Thy servant\\r\\nYulya, eternal memory to her! She was never married, and when she was\\r\\ndying she divided all her property; she left three hundred acres to the\\r\\nmonastery, and six hundred to the commune of peasants of Nedoshtchotova\\r\\nto commemorate her soul; but her brother hid the will, they do say burnt\\r\\nit in the stove, and took all this land for himself. He thought, to be\\r\\nsure, it was for his benefit; but--nay, wait a bit, you won’t get on\\r\\nin the world through injustice, brother. The gentleman did not go to\\r\\nconfession for twenty years after. He kept away from the church, to be\\r\\nsure, and died impenitent. He burst. He was a very fat man, so he\\r\\nburst lengthways. Then everything was taken from the young master, from\\r\\nSeryozha, to pay the debts--everything there was. Well, he had not gone\\r\\nvery far in his studies, he couldn’t do anything, and the president of\\r\\nthe Rural Board, his uncle--‘I’ll take him’--Seryozha, I mean--thinks\\r\\nhe, ‘for an agent; let him collect the insurance, that’s not a difficult\\r\\njob,’ and the gentleman was young and proud, he wanted to be living on\\r\\na bigger scale and in better style and with more freedom. To be sure it\\r\\nwas a come-down for him to be jolting about the district in a wretched\\r\\ncart and talking to the peasants; he would walk and keep looking on the\\r\\nground, looking on the ground and saying nothing; if you called his name\\r\\nright in his ear, ‘Sergey Sergeyitch!’ he would look round like this,\\r\\n‘Eh?’ and look down on the ground again, and now you see he has laid\\r\\nhands on himself. There’s no sense in it, your honor, it’s not right,\\r\\nand there’s no making out what’s the meaning of it, merciful Lord! Say\\r\\nyour father was rich and you are poor; it is mortifying, there’s no\\r\\ndoubt about it, but there, you must make up your mind to it. I used to\\r\\nlive in good style, too; I had two horses, your honor, three cows, I\\r\\nused to keep twenty head of sheep; but the time has come, and I am\\r\\nleft with nothing but a wretched bag, and even that is not mine but\\r\\nGovernment property. And now in our Nedoshtchotova, if the truth is to\\r\\nbe told, my house is the worst of the lot. Makey had four footmen, and\\r\\nnow Makey is a footman himself. Petrak had four laborers, and now Petrak\\r\\nis a laborer himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How was it you became poor?” asked the examining magistrate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My sons drink terribly. I could not tell you how they drink, you\\r\\nwouldn’t believe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLyzhin listened and thought how he, Lyzhin, would go back sooner or\\r\\nlater to Moscow, while this old man would stay here for ever, and would\\r\\nalways be walking and walking. And how many times in his life he would\\r\\ncome across such battered, unkempt old men, not “men of any worth,” in\\r\\nwhose souls fifteen kopecks, glasses of vodka, and a profound belief\\r\\nthat you can’t get on in this life by dishonesty, were equally firmly\\r\\nrooted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he grew tired of listening, and told the old man to bring him some\\r\\nhay for his bed, There was an iron bedstead with a pillow and a quilt in\\r\\nthe traveler’s room, and it could be fetched in; but the dead man had\\r\\nbeen lying by it for nearly three days (and perhaps sitting on it just\\r\\nbefore his death), and it would be disagreeable to sleep upon it\\r\\nnow....\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s only half-past seven,” thought Lyzhin, glancing at his watch. “How\\r\\nawful it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not sleepy, but having nothing to do to pass away the time,\\r\\nhe lay down and covered himself with a rug. Loshadin went in and out\\r\\nseveral times, clearing away the tea-things; smacking his lips and\\r\\nsighing, he kept tramping round the table; at last he took his little\\r\\nlamp and went out, and, looking at his long, gray-headed, bent figure\\r\\nfrom behind, Lyzhin thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just like a magician in an opera.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dark. The moon must have been behind the clouds, as the windows\\r\\nand the snow on the window-frames could be seen distinctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oo-oo-oo!” sang the storm, “Oo-oo-oo-oo!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ho-ho-ly sa-aints!” wailed a woman in the loft, or it sounded like it.\\r\\n“Ho-ho-ly sa-aints!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-booh!” something outside banged against the wall. “Trah!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe examining magistrate listened: there was no woman up there, it was\\r\\nthe wind howling. It was rather cold, and he put his fur coat over his\\r\\nrug. As he got warm he thought how remote all this--the storm, and the\\r\\nhut, and the old man, and the dead body lying in the next room--how\\r\\nremote it all was from the life he desired for himself, and how alien\\r\\nit all was to him, how petty, how uninteresting. If this man had killed\\r\\nhimself in Moscow or somewhere in the neighborhood, and he had had to\\r\\nhold an inquest on him there, it would have been interesting, important,\\r\\nand perhaps he might even have been afraid to sleep in the next room to\\r\\nthe corpse. Here, nearly a thousand miles from Moscow, all this was\\r\\nseen somehow in a different light; it was not life, they were not human\\r\\nbeings, but something only existing “according to the regulation,” as\\r\\nLoshadin said; it would leave not the faintest trace in the memory, and\\r\\nwould be forgotten as soon as he, Lyzhin, drove away from Syrnya. The\\r\\nfatherland, the real Russia, was Moscow, Petersburg; but here he was in\\r\\nthe provinces, the colonies. When one dreamed of playing a leading\\r\\npart, of becoming a popular figure, of being, for instance, examining\\r\\nmagistrate in particularly important cases or prosecutor in a circuit\\r\\ncourt, of being a society lion, one always thought of Moscow. To live,\\r\\none must be in Moscow; here one cared for nothing, one grew easily\\r\\nresigned to one’s insignificant position, and only expected one thing of\\r\\nlife--to get away quickly, quickly. And Lyzhin mentally moved about\\r\\nthe Moscow streets, went into the familiar houses, met his kindred, his\\r\\ncomrades, and there was a sweet pang at his heart at the thought that\\r\\nhe was only twenty-six, and that if in five or ten years he could break\\r\\naway from here and get to Moscow, even then it would not be too late\\r\\nand he would still have a whole life before him. And as he sank into\\r\\nunconsciousness, as his thoughts began to be confused, he imagined the\\r\\nlong corridor of the court at Moscow, himself delivering a speech, his\\r\\nsisters, the orchestra which for some reason kept droning: “Oo-oo-oo-oo!\\r\\nOo-oooo-oo!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Booh! Trah!” sounded again. “Booh!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he suddenly recalled how one day, when he was talking to the\\r\\nbookkeeper in the little office of the Rural Board, a thin, pale\\r\\ngentleman with black hair and dark eyes walked in; he had a disagreeable\\r\\nlook in his eyes such as one sees in people who have slept too long\\r\\nafter dinner, and it spoilt his delicate, intelligent profile; and\\r\\nthe high boots he was wearing did not suit him, but looked clumsy. The\\r\\nbookkeeper had introduced him: “This is our insurance agent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that was Lesnitsky,... this same man,” Lyzhin reflected now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recalled Lesnitsky’s soft voice, imagined his gait, and it seemed\\r\\nto him that someone was walking beside him now with a step like\\r\\nLesnitsky’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once he felt frightened, his head turned cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” he asked in alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The conshtable!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have come to ask, your honor--you said this evening that you did not\\r\\nwant the elder, but I am afraid he may be angry. He told me to go to\\r\\nhim. Shouldn’t I go?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough, you bother me,” said Lyzhin with vexation, and he\\r\\ncovered himself up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He may be angry.... I’ll go, your honor. I hope you will be\\r\\ncomfortable,” and Loshadin went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the passage there was coughing and subdued voices. The witnesses must\\r\\nhave returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll let those poor beggars get away early to-morrow,...” thought\\r\\nthe examining magistrate; “we’ll begin the inquest as soon as it is\\r\\ndaylight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began sinking into forgetfulness when suddenly there were steps\\r\\nagain, not timid this time but rapid and noisy. There was the slam of a\\r\\ndoor, voices, the scratching of a match....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you asleep? Are you asleep?” Dr. Startchenko was asking him\\r\\nhurriedly and angrily as he struck one match after another; he was\\r\\ncovered with snow, and brought a chill air in with him. “Are you asleep?\\r\\nGet up! Let us go to Von Taunitz’s. He has sent his own horses for you.\\r\\nCome along. There, at any rate, you will have supper, and sleep like\\r\\na human being. You see I have come for you myself. The horses are\\r\\nsplendid, we shall get there in twenty minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what time is it now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A quarter past ten.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLyzhin, sleepy and discontented, put on his felt overboots, his fur-lined\\r\\ncoat, his cap and hood, and went out with the doctor. There was not\\r\\na very sharp frost, but a violent and piercing wind was blowing and\\r\\ndriving along the street the clouds of snow which seemed to be racing\\r\\naway in terror: high drifts were heaped up already under the fences and\\r\\nat the doorways. The doctor and the examining magistrate got into the\\r\\nsledge, and the white coachman bent over them to button up the cover.\\r\\nThey were both hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove through the village. “Cutting a feathery furrow,” thought\\r\\nthe examining magistrate, listlessly watching the action of the trace\\r\\nhorse’s legs. There were lights in all the huts, as though it were the\\r\\neve of a great holiday: the peasants had not gone to bed because they\\r\\nwere afraid of the dead body. The coachman preserved a sullen silence,\\r\\nprobably he had felt dreary while he was waiting by the Zemstvo hut, and\\r\\nnow he, too, was thinking of the dead man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the Von Taunitz’s,” said Startchenko, “they all set upon me when\\r\\nthey heard that you were left to spend the night in the hut, and asked\\r\\nme why I did not bring you with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they drove out of the village, at the turning the coachman suddenly\\r\\nshouted at the top of his voice: “Out of the way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey caught a glimpse of a man: he was standing up to his knees in\\r\\nthe snow, moving off the road and staring at the horses. The examining\\r\\nmagistrate saw a stick with a crook, and a beard and a bag, and he\\r\\nfancied that it was Loshadin, and even fancied that he was smiling. He\\r\\nflashed by and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road ran at first along the edge of the forest, then along a broad\\r\\nforest clearing; they caught glimpses of old pines and a young birch\\r\\ncopse, and tall, gnarled young oak trees standing singly in the\\r\\nclearings where the wood had lately been cut; but soon it was all merged\\r\\nin the clouds of snow. The coachman said he could see the forest; the\\r\\nexamining magistrate could see nothing but the trace horse. The wind\\r\\nblew on their backs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once the horses stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what is it now?” asked Startchenko crossly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman got down from the box without a word and began running\\r\\nround the sledge, treading on his heels; he made larger and larger\\r\\ncircles, getting further and further away from the sledge, and it looked\\r\\nas though he were dancing; at last he came back and began to turn off to\\r\\nthe right.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got off the road, eh?” asked Startchenko.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all ri-ight....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was a little village and not a single light in it. Again the\\r\\nforest and the fields. Again they lost the road, and again the coachman\\r\\ngot down from the box and danced round the sledge. The sledge flew\\r\\nalong a dark avenue, flew swiftly on. And the heated trace horse’s hoofs\\r\\nknocked against the sledge. Here there was a fearful roaring sound from\\r\\nthe trees, and nothing could be seen, as though they were flying on into\\r\\nspace; and all at once the glaring light at the entrance and the windows\\r\\nflashed upon their eyes, and they heard the good-natured, drawn-out\\r\\nbarking of dogs. They had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were taking off their fur coats and their felt boots below,\\r\\n“Un Petit Verre de Clicquot” was being played upon the piano overhead,\\r\\nand they could hear the children beating time with their feet.\\r\\nImmediately on going in they were aware of the snug warmth and special\\r\\nsmell of the old apartments of a mansion where, whatever the weather\\r\\noutside, life is so warm and clean and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s capital!” said Von Taunitz, a fat man with an incredibly thick\\r\\nneck and with whiskers, as he shook the examining magistrate’s\\r\\nhand. “That’s capital! You are very welcome, delighted to make your\\r\\nacquaintance. We are colleagues to some extent, you know. At one time I\\r\\nwas deputy prosecutor; but not for long, only two years. I came here to\\r\\nlook after the estate, and here I have grown old--an old fogey, in fact.\\r\\nYou are very welcome,” he went on, evidently restraining his voice so as\\r\\nnot to speak too loud; he was going upstairs with his guests. “I have no\\r\\nwife, she’s dead. But here, I will introduce my daughters,” and turning\\r\\nround, he shouted down the stairs in a voice of thunder: “Tell Ignat to\\r\\nhave the sledge ready at eight o’clock to-morrow morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis four daughters, young and pretty girls, all wearing gray dresses and\\r\\nwith their hair done up in the same style, and their cousin, also young\\r\\nand attractive, with her children, were in the drawing-room. Startchenko,\\r\\nwho knew them already, began at once begging them to sing something, and\\r\\ntwo of the young ladies spent a long time declaring they could not sing\\r\\nand that they had no music; then the cousin sat down to the piano, and\\r\\nwith trembling voices, they sang a duet from “The Queen of Spades.”\\r\\n Again “Un Petit Verre de Clicquot” was played, and the children skipped\\r\\nabout, beating time with their feet. And Startchenko pranced about too.\\r\\nEverybody laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the children said good-night and went off to bed. The examining\\r\\nmagistrate laughed, danced a quadrille, flirted, and kept wondering\\r\\nwhether it was not all a dream? The kitchen of the Zemstvo hut, the\\r\\nheap of hay in the corner, the rustle of the beetles, the revolting\\r\\npoverty-stricken surroundings, the voices of the witnesses, the wind,\\r\\nthe snow storm, the danger of being lost; and then all at once this\\r\\nsplendid, brightly lighted room, the sounds of the piano, the lovely\\r\\ngirls, the curly-headed children, the gay, happy laughter--such a\\r\\ntransformation seemed to him like a fairy tale, and it seemed incredible\\r\\nthat such transitions were possible at the distance of some two miles in\\r\\nthe course of one hour. And dreary thoughts prevented him from enjoying\\r\\nhimself, and he kept thinking this was not life here, but bits of life\\r\\nfragments, that everything here was accidental, that one could draw no\\r\\nconclusions from it; and he even felt sorry for these girls, who were\\r\\nliving and would end their lives in the wilds, in a province far away\\r\\nfrom the center of culture, where nothing is accidental, but everything\\r\\nis in accordance with reason and law, and where, for instance, every\\r\\nsuicide is intelligible, so that one can explain why it has happened and\\r\\nwhat is its significance in the general scheme of things. He imagined\\r\\nthat if the life surrounding him here in the wilds were not intelligible\\r\\nto him, and if he did not see it, it meant that it did not exist at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt supper the conversation turned on Lesnitsky.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He left a wife and child,” said Startchenko. “I would forbid\\r\\nneurasthenics and all people whose nervous system is out of order to\\r\\nmarry, I would deprive them of the right and possibility of multiplying\\r\\ntheir kind. To bring into the world nervous, invalid children is a\\r\\ncrime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was an unfortunate young man,” said Von Taunitz, sighing gently and\\r\\nshaking his head. “What a lot one must suffer and think about before\\r\\none brings oneself to take one’s own life,... a young life! Such a\\r\\nmisfortune may happen in any family, and that is awful. It is hard to\\r\\nbear such a thing, insufferable....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the girls listened in silence with grave faces, looking at their\\r\\nfather. Lyzhin felt that he, too, must say something, but he couldn’t\\r\\nthink of anything, and merely said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, suicide is an undesirable phenomenon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slept in a warm room, in a soft bed covered with a quilt under\\r\\nwhich there were fine clean sheets, but for some reason did not feel\\r\\ncomfortable: perhaps because the doctor and Von Taunitz were, for a long\\r\\ntime, talking in the adjoining room, and overhead he heard, through the\\r\\nceiling and in the stove, the wind roaring just as in the Zemstvo hut,\\r\\nand as plaintively howling: “Oo-oo-oo-oo!”\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Taunitz’s wife had died two years before, and he was still unable\\r\\nto resign himself to his loss and, whatever he was talking about, always\\r\\nmentioned his wife; and there was no trace of a prosecutor left about\\r\\nhim now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible that I may some day come to such a condition?” thought\\r\\nLyzhin, as he fell asleep, still hearing through the wall his host’s\\r\\nsubdued, as it were bereaved, voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe examining magistrate did not sleep soundly. He felt hot and\\r\\nuncomfortable, and it seemed to him in his sleep that he was not at\\r\\nVon Taunitz’s, and not in a soft clean bed, but still in the hay at the\\r\\nZemstvo hut, hearing the subdued voices of the witnesses; he fancied\\r\\nthat Lesnitsky was close by, not fifteen paces away. In his dreams he\\r\\nremembered how the insurance agent, black-haired and pale, wearing\\r\\ndusty high boots, had come into the bookkeeper’s office. “This is our\\r\\ninsurance agent....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he dreamed that Lesnitsky and Loshadin the constable were walking\\r\\nthrough the open country in the snow, side by side, supporting each\\r\\nother; the snow was whirling about their heads, the wind was blowing on\\r\\ntheir backs, but they walked on, singing: “We go on, and on, and\\r\\non....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man was like a magician in an opera, and both of them were\\r\\nsinging as though they were on the stage:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We go on, and on, and on!... You are in the warmth, in the light\\r\\nand snugness, but we are walking in the frost and the storm, through the\\r\\ndeep snow.... We know nothing of ease, we know nothing of joy....\\r\\nWe bear all the burden of this life, yours and ours.... Oo-oo-oo! We\\r\\ngo on, and on, and on....”\\r\\n\\r\\nLyzhin woke and sat up in bed. What a confused, bad dream! And why did\\r\\nhe dream of the constable and the agent together? What nonsense! And now\\r\\nwhile Lyzhin’s heart was throbbing violently and he was sitting on his\\r\\nbed, holding his head in his hands, it seemed to him that there really\\r\\nwas something in common between the lives of the insurance agent and the\\r\\nconstable. Don’t they really go side by side holding each other up? Some\\r\\ntie unseen, but significant and essential, existed between them, and\\r\\neven between them and Von Taunitz and between all men--all men; in this\\r\\nlife, even in the remotest desert, nothing is accidental, everything\\r\\nis full of one common idea, everything has one soul, one aim, and to\\r\\nunderstand it it is not enough to think, it is not enough to reason, one\\r\\nmust have also, it seems, the gift of insight into life, a gift which is\\r\\nevidently not bestowed on all. And the unhappy man who had broken\\r\\ndown, who had killed himself--the “neurasthenic,” as the doctor called\\r\\nhim--and the old peasant who spent every day of his life going from one\\r\\nman to another, were only accidental, were only fragments of life for\\r\\none who thought of his own life as accidental, but were parts of one\\r\\norganism--marvelous and rational--for one who thought of his own life as\\r\\npart of that universal whole and understood it. So thought Lyzhin, and\\r\\nit was a thought that had long lain hidden in his soul, and only now it\\r\\nwas unfolded broadly and clearly to his consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lay down and began to drop asleep; and again they were going along\\r\\ntogether, singing: “We go on, and on, and on.... We take from life\\r\\nwhat is hardest and bitterest in it, and we leave you what is easy and\\r\\njoyful; and sitting at supper, you can coldly and sensibly discuss why\\r\\nwe suffer and perish, and why we are not as sound and as satisfied as\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat they were singing had occurred to his mind before, but the thought\\r\\nwas somewhere in the background behind his other thoughts, and flickered\\r\\ntimidly like a faraway light in foggy weather. And he felt that this\\r\\nsuicide and the peasant’s sufferings lay upon his conscience, too; to\\r\\nresign himself to the fact that these people, submissive to their fate,\\r\\nshould take up the burden of what was hardest and gloomiest in life--how\\r\\nawful it was! To accept this, and to desire for himself a life full\\r\\nof light and movement among happy and contented people, and to be\\r\\ncontinually dreaming of such, means dreaming of fresh suicides of men\\r\\ncrushed by toil and anxiety, or of men weak and outcast whom people only\\r\\ntalk of sometimes at supper with annoyance or mockery, without going to\\r\\ntheir help.... And again:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We go on, and on, and on...” as though someone were beating with a\\r\\nhammer on his temples.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe woke early in the morning with a headache, roused by a noise; in the\\r\\nnext room Von Taunitz was saying loudly to the doctor:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s impossible for you to go now. Look what’s going on outside.\\r\\nDon’t argue, you had better ask the coachman; he won’t take you in such\\r\\nweather for a million.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s only two miles,” said the doctor in an imploring voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if it were only half a mile. If you can’t, then you can’t.\\r\\nDirectly you drive out of the gates it is perfect hell, you would be off\\r\\nthe road in a minute. Nothing will induce me to let you go, you can say\\r\\nwhat you like.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bound to be quieter towards evening,” said the peasant who was\\r\\nheating the stove.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the next room the doctor began talking of the rigorous climate\\r\\nand its influence on the character of the Russian, of the long\\r\\nwinters which, by preventing movement from place to place, hinder\\r\\nthe intellectual development of the people; and Lyzhin listened with\\r\\nvexation to these observations and looked out of window at the snow\\r\\ndrifts which were piled on the fence. He gazed at the white dust which\\r\\ncovered the whole visible expanse, at the trees which bowed their heads\\r\\ndespairingly to right and then to left, listened to the howling and the\\r\\nbanging, and thought gloomily:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what moral can be drawn from it? It’s a blizzard and that is all\\r\\nabout it....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midday they had lunch, then wandered aimlessly about the house; they\\r\\nwent to the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Lesnitsky is lying there,” thought Lyzhin, watching the whirling\\r\\nsnow, which raced furiously round and round upon the drifts. “Lesnitsky\\r\\nis lying there, the witnesses are waiting....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked of the weather, saying that the snowstorm usually lasted\\r\\ntwo days and nights, rarely longer. At six o’clock they had dinner, then\\r\\nthey played cards, sang, danced; at last they had supper. The day was\\r\\nover, they went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the night, towards morning, it all subsided. When they got up and\\r\\nlooked out of window, the bare willows with their weakly drooping\\r\\nbranches were standing perfectly motionless; it was dull and still, as\\r\\nthough nature now were ashamed of its orgy, of its mad nights, and the\\r\\nlicense it had given to its passions. The horses, harnessed tandem, had\\r\\nbeen waiting at the front door since five o’clock in the morning. When\\r\\nit was fully daylight the doctor and the examining magistrate put on\\r\\ntheir fur coats and felt boots, and, saying good-by to their host, went\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the steps beside the coachman stood the familiar figure of the\\r\\nconstable, Ilya Loshadin, with an old leather bag across his shoulder\\r\\nand no cap on his head, covered with snow all over, and his face was\\r\\nred and wet with perspiration. The footman who had come out to help the\\r\\ngentlemen and cover their legs looked at him sternly and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you standing here for, you old devil? Get away!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor, the people are anxious,” said Loshadin, smiling naively all\\r\\nover his face, and evidently pleased at seeing at last the people he\\r\\nhad waited for so long. “The people are very uneasy, the children are\\r\\ncrying.... They thought, your honor, that you had gone back to the\\r\\ntown again. Show us the heavenly mercy, our benefactors!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor and the examining magistrate said nothing, got into the\\r\\nsledge, and drove to Syrnya.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIRST-CLASS PASSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\nA FIRST-CLASS passenger who had just dined at the station and drunk a\\r\\nlittle too much lay down on the velvet-covered seat, stretched himself\\r\\nout luxuriously, and sank into a doze. After a nap of no more than five\\r\\nminutes, he looked with oily eyes at his _vis-a-vis,_ gave a smirk, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My father of blessed memory used to like to have his heels tickled by\\r\\npeasant women after dinner. I am just like him, with this difference,\\r\\nthat after dinner I always like my tongue and my brains gently\\r\\nstimulated. Sinful man as I am, I like empty talk on a full stomach.\\r\\nWill you allow me to have a chat with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be delighted,” answered the _vis-a-vis._\\r\\n\\r\\n“After a good dinner the most trifling subject is sufficient to arouse\\r\\ndevilishly great thoughts in my brain. For instance, we saw just now\\r\\nnear the refreshment bar two young men, and you heard one congratulate\\r\\nthe other on being celebrated. ‘I congratulate you,’ he said; ‘you are\\r\\nalready a celebrity and are beginning to win fame.’ Evidently actors or\\r\\njournalists of microscopic dimensions. But they are not the point. The\\r\\nquestion that is occupying my mind at the moment, sir, is exactly what\\r\\nis to be understood by the word _fame_ or _charity_. What do you\\r\\nthink? Pushkin called fame a bright patch on a ragged garment; we all\\r\\nunderstand it as Pushkin does--that is, more or less subjectively--but\\r\\nno one has yet given a clear, logical definition of the word.... I\\r\\nwould give a good deal for such a definition!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you feel such a need for it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, if we knew what fame is, the means of attaining it might\\r\\nalso perhaps be known to us,” said the first-class passenger, after a\\r\\nmoment’s thought. “I must tell you, sir, that when I was younger I strove\\r\\nafter celebrity with every fiber of my being. To be popular was my\\r\\ncraze, so to speak. For the sake of it I studied, worked, sat up at\\r\\nnight, neglected my meals. And I fancy, as far as I can judge without\\r\\npartiality, I had all the natural gifts for attaining it. To begin with,\\r\\nI am an engineer by profession. In the course of my life I have built\\r\\nin Russia some two dozen magnificent bridges, I have laid aqueducts\\r\\nfor three towns; I have worked in Russia, in England, in Belgium....\\r\\nSecondly, I am the author of several special treatises in my own\\r\\nline. And thirdly, my dear sir, I have from a boy had a weakness for\\r\\nchemistry. Studying that science in my leisure hours, I discovered\\r\\nmethods of obtaining certain organic acids, so that you will find my\\r\\nname in all the foreign manuals of chemistry. I have always been in the\\r\\nservice, I have risen to the grade of actual civil councilor, and I have\\r\\nan unblemished record. I will not fatigue your attention by enumerating\\r\\nmy works and my merits, I will only say that I have done far more than\\r\\nsome celebrities. And yet here I am in my old age, I am getting ready\\r\\nfor my coffin, so to say, and I am as celebrated as that black dog\\r\\nyonder running on the embankment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you tell? Perhaps you are celebrated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“H’m! Well, we will test it at once. Tell me, have you ever heard the\\r\\nname Krikunov?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _vis-a-vis_ raised his eyes to the ceiling, thought a minute, and\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I haven’t heard it,...” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is my surname. You, a man of education, getting on in years, have\\r\\nnever heard of me--a convincing proof! It is evident that in my efforts\\r\\nto gain fame I have not done the right thing at all: I did not know the\\r\\nright way to set to work, and, trying to catch fame by the tail, got on\\r\\nthe wrong side of her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the right way to set to work?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, the devil only knows! Talent, you say? Genius? Originality? Not\\r\\na bit of it, sir!... People have lived and made a career side by side\\r\\nwith me who were worthless, trivial, and even contemptible compared with\\r\\nme. They did not do one-tenth of the work I did, did not put themselves\\r\\nout, were not distinguished for their talents, and did not make\\r\\nan effort to be celebrated, but just look at them! Their names are\\r\\ncontinually in the newspapers and on men’s lips! If you are not tired of\\r\\nlistening I will illustrate it by an example. Some years ago I built\\r\\na bridge in the town of K. I must tell you that the dullness of that\\r\\nscurvy little town was terrible. If it had not been for women and cards\\r\\nI believe I should have gone out of my mind. Well, it’s an old story:\\r\\nI was so bored that I got into an affair with a singer. Everyone was\\r\\nenthusiastic about her, the devil only knows why; to my thinking she\\r\\nwas--what shall I say?--an ordinary, commonplace creature, like lots\\r\\nof others. The hussy was empty-headed, ill-tempered, greedy, and what’s\\r\\nmore, she was a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She ate and drank a vast amount, slept till five o clock in the\\r\\nafternoon--and I fancy did nothing else. She was looked upon as a\\r\\ncocotte, and that was indeed her profession; but when people wanted to\\r\\nrefer to her in a literary fashion, they called her an actress and\\r\\na singer. I used to be devoted to the theatre, and therefore this\\r\\nfraudulent pretense of being an actress made me furiously indignant. My\\r\\nyoung lady had not the slightest right to call herself an actress or\\r\\na singer. She was a creature entirely devoid of talent, devoid of\\r\\nfeeling--a pitiful creature one may say. As far as I can judge she sang\\r\\ndisgustingly. The whole charm of her ‘art’ lay in her kicking up her\\r\\nlegs on every suitable occasion, and not being embarrassed when\\r\\npeople walked into her dressing-room. She usually selected translated\\r\\nvaudevilles, with singing in them, and opportunities for disporting\\r\\nherself in male attire, in tights. In fact it was--ough! Well, I ask\\r\\nyour attention. As I remember now, a public ceremony took place to\\r\\ncelebrate the opening of the newly constructed bridge. There was a\\r\\nreligious service, there were speeches, telegrams, and so on. I hung\\r\\nabout my cherished creation, you know, all the while afraid that my\\r\\nheart would burst with the excitement of an author. It’s an old story and\\r\\nthere’s no need for false modesty, and so I will tell you that my bridge\\r\\nwas a magnificent work! It was not a bridge but a picture, a perfect\\r\\ndelight! And who would not have been excited when the whole town came to\\r\\nthe opening? ‘Oh,’ I thought, ‘now the eyes of all the public will be\\r\\non me! Where shall I hide myself?’ Well, I need not have worried myself,\\r\\nsir--alas! Except the official personages, no one took the slightest\\r\\nnotice of me. They stood in a crowd on the river-bank, gazed like sheep\\r\\nat the bridge, and did not concern themselves to know who had built\\r\\nit. And it was from that time, by the way, that I began to hate our\\r\\nestimable public--damnation take them! Well, to continue. All at once\\r\\nthe public became agitated; a whisper ran through the crowd,... a\\r\\nsmile came on their faces, their shoulders began to move. ‘They must\\r\\nhave seen me,’ I thought. A likely idea! I looked, and my singer, with a\\r\\ntrain of young scamps, was making her way through the crowd. The eyes of\\r\\nthe crowd were hurriedly following this procession. A whisper began in a\\r\\nthousand voices: ‘That’s so-and-so.... Charming! Bewitching!’ Then it\\r\\nwas they noticed me.... A couple of young milksops, local amateurs\\r\\nof the scenic art, I presume, looked at me, exchanged glances,\\r\\nand whispered: ‘That’s her lover!’ How do you like that? And an\\r\\nunprepossessing individual in a top-hat, with a chin that badly needed\\r\\nshaving, hung round me, shifting from one foot to the other, then turned\\r\\nto me with the words:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you know who that lady is, walking on the other bank? That’s\\r\\nso-and-so.... Her voice is beneath all criticism, but she has a most\\r\\nperfect mastery of it!...’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Can you tell me,’ I asked the unprepossessing individual, ‘who built\\r\\nthis bridge?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I really don’t know,’ answered the individual; some engineer, I\\r\\nexpect.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And who built the cathedral in your town?’ I asked again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I really can’t tell you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I asked him who was considered the best teacher in K., who the\\r\\nbest architect, and to all my questions the unprepossessing individual\\r\\nanswered that he did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And tell me, please,’ I asked in conclusion, with whom is that singer\\r\\nliving?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘With some engineer called Krikunov.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, how do you like that, sir? But to proceed. There are no\\r\\nminnesingers or bards nowadays, and celebrity is created almost\\r\\nexclusively by the newspapers. The day after the dedication of the\\r\\nbridge, I greedily snatched up the local _Messenger,_ and looked for\\r\\nmyself in it. I spent a long time running my eyes over all the four\\r\\npages, and at last there it was--hurrah! I began reading: ‘Yesterday in\\r\\nbeautiful weather, before a vast concourse of people, in the presence\\r\\nof His Excellency the Governor of the province, so-and-so, and other\\r\\ndignitaries, the ceremony of the dedication of the newly constructed\\r\\nbridge took place,’ and so on.... Towards the end: Our talented\\r\\nactress so-and-so, the favorite of the K. public, was present at the\\r\\ndedication looking very beautiful. I need not say that her arrival\\r\\ncreated a sensation. The star was wearing...’ and so on. They might\\r\\nhave given me one word! Half a word. Petty as it seems, I actually cried\\r\\nwith vexation!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I consoled myself with the reflection that the provinces are stupid,\\r\\nand one could expect nothing of them and for celebrity one must go\\r\\nto the intellectual centers--to Petersburg and to Moscow. And as it\\r\\nhappened, at that very time there was a work of mine in Petersburg which\\r\\nI had sent in for a competition. The date on which the result was to be\\r\\ndeclared was at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I took leave of K. and went to Petersburg. It is a long journey from\\r\\nK. to Petersburg, and that I might not be bored on the journey I took a\\r\\nreserved compartment and--well--of course, I took my singer. We set off,\\r\\nand all the way we were eating, drinking champagne, and--tra-la-la! But\\r\\nbehold, at last we reach the intellectual center. I arrived on the very\\r\\nday the result was declared, and had the satisfaction, my dear sir, of\\r\\ncelebrating my own success: my work received the first prize. Hurrah!\\r\\nNext day I went out along the Nevsky and spent seventy kopecks on\\r\\nvarious newspapers. I hastened to my hotel room, lay down on the sofa,\\r\\nand, controlling a quiver of excitement, made haste to read. I ran\\r\\nthrough one newspaper--nothing. I ran through a second--nothing either;\\r\\nmy God! At last, in the fourth, I lighted upon the following paragraph:\\r\\n‘Yesterday the well-known provincial actress so-and-so arrived by\\r\\nexpress in Petersburg. We note with pleasure that the climate of the\\r\\nSouth has had a beneficial effect on our fair friend; her charming stage\\r\\nappearance...’ and I don’t remember the rest! Much lower down than\\r\\nthat paragraph I found, printed in the smallest type: ‘First prize in the\\r\\ncompetition was adjudged to an engineer called so-and-so.’ That was\\r\\nall! And to make things better, they even misspelt my name: instead of\\r\\nKrikunov it was Kirkutlov. So much for your intellectual center! But\\r\\nthat was not all.... By the time I left Petersburg, a month later,\\r\\nall the newspapers were vying with one another in discussing our\\r\\nincomparable, divine, highly talented actress, and my mistress was\\r\\nreferred to, not by her surname, but by her Christian name and her\\r\\nfather’s....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some years later I was in Moscow. I was summoned there by a letter, in\\r\\nthe mayor’s own handwriting, to undertake a work for which Moscow, in\\r\\nits newspapers, had been clamoring for over a hundred years. In\\r\\nthe intervals of my work I delivered five public lectures, with a\\r\\nphilanthropic object, in one of the museums there. One would have\\r\\nthought that was enough to make one known to the whole town for three\\r\\ndays at least, wouldn’t one? But, alas! not a single Moscow gazette\\r\\nsaid a word about me. There was something about houses on fire, about\\r\\nan operetta, sleeping town councilors, drunken shop keepers--about\\r\\neverything; but about my work, my plans, my lectures--mum. And a nice\\r\\nset they are in Moscow! I got into a tram.... It was packed full;\\r\\nthere were ladies and military men and students of both sexes, creatures\\r\\nof all sorts in couples.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am told the town council has sent for an engineer to plan such and\\r\\nsuch a work!’ I said to my neighbor, so loudly that all the tram could\\r\\nhear. ‘Do you know the name of the engineer?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“My neighbor shook his head. The rest of the public took a cursory\\r\\nglance at me, and in all their eyes I read: ‘I don’t know.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am told that there is someone giving lectures in such and such a\\r\\nmuseum?’ I persisted, trying to get up a conversation. ‘I hear it is\\r\\ninteresting.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one even nodded. Evidently they had not all of them heard of the\\r\\nlectures, and the ladies were not even aware of the existence of the\\r\\nmuseum. All that would not have mattered, but imagine, my dear sir, the\\r\\npeople suddenly leaped to their feet and struggled to the windows. What\\r\\nwas it? What was the matter?\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Look, look!’ my neighbor nudged me. ‘Do you see that dark man getting\\r\\ninto that cab? That’s the famous runner, King!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the whole tram began talking breathlessly of the runner who was\\r\\nthen absorbing the brains of Moscow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could give you ever so many other examples, but I think that is\\r\\nenough. Now let us assume that I am mistaken about myself, that I am\\r\\na wretchedly boastful and incompetent person; but apart from myself\\r\\nI might point to many of my contemporaries, men remarkable for their\\r\\ntalent and industry, who have nevertheless died unrecognized.\\r\\nAre Russian navigators, chemists, physicists, mechanicians, and\\r\\nagriculturists popular with the public? Do our cultivated masses know\\r\\nanything of Russian artists, sculptors, and literary men? Some old\\r\\nliterary hack, hard-working and talented, will wear away the doorstep of\\r\\nthe publishers’ offices for thirty-three years, cover reams of paper, be\\r\\nhad up for libel twenty times, and yet not step beyond his ant-heap. Can\\r\\nyou mention to me a single representative of our literature who would\\r\\nhave become celebrated if the rumor had not been spread over the earth\\r\\nthat he had been killed in a duel, gone out of his mind, been sent into\\r\\nexile, or had cheated at cards?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first-class passenger was so excited that he dropped his cigar out\\r\\nof his mouth and got up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” he went on fiercely, “and side by side with these people I can\\r\\nquote you hundreds of all sorts of singers, acrobats, buffoons, whose\\r\\nnames are known to every baby. Yes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door creaked, there was a draught, and an individual of forbidding\\r\\naspect, wearing an Inverness coat, a top-hat, and blue spectacles,\\r\\nwalked into the carriage. The individual looked round at the seats,\\r\\nfrowned, and went on further.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know who that is?” there came a timid whisper from the furthest\\r\\ncorner of the compartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is N. N., the famous Tula cardsharper who was had up in connection\\r\\nwith the Y. bank affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There you are!” laughed the first-class passenger. “He knows a Tula\\r\\ncardsharper, but ask him whether he knows Semiradsky, Tchaykovsky, or\\r\\nSolovyov the philosopher--he’ll shake his head.... It swinish!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThree minutes passed in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Allow me in my turn to ask you a question,” said the _vis-a-vis_\\r\\ntimidly, clearing his throat. “Do you know the name of Pushkov?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pushkov? H’m! Pushkov.... No, I don’t know it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is my name,...” said the _vis-a-vis,_, overcome with\\r\\nembarrassment. “Then you don’t know it? And yet I have been a professor\\r\\nat one of the Russian universities for thirty-five years,... a member\\r\\nof the Academy of Sciences,... have published more than one work....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first-class passenger and the _vis-a-vis_ looked at each other and\\r\\nburst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TRAGIC ACTOR\\r\\n\\r\\nIT was the benefit night of Fenogenov, the tragic actor. They were\\r\\nacting “Prince Serebryany.” The tragedian himself was playing Vyazemsky;\\r\\nLimonadov, the stage manager, was playing Morozov; Madame Beobahtov,\\r\\nElena. The performance was a grand success. The tragedian accomplished\\r\\nwonders indeed. When he was carrying off Elena, he held her in one hand\\r\\nabove his head as he dashed across the stage. He shouted, hissed, banged\\r\\nwith his feet, tore his coat across his chest. When he refused to fight\\r\\nMorozov, he trembled all over as nobody ever trembles in reality, and\\r\\ngasped loudly. The theatre shook with applause. There were endless\\r\\ncalls. Fenogenov was presented with a silver cigarette-case and a\\r\\nbouquet tied with long ribbons. The ladies waved their handkerchiefs and\\r\\nurged their men to applaud, many shed tears.... But the one who was\\r\\nthe most enthusiastic and most excited was Masha, daughter of Sidoretsky\\r\\nthe police captain. She was sitting in the first row of the stalls\\r\\nbeside her papa; she was ecstatic and could not take her eyes off the\\r\\nstage even between the acts. Her delicate little hands and feet were\\r\\nquivering, her eyes were full of tears, her cheeks turned paler and\\r\\npaler. And no wonder--she was at the theatre for the first time in her\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How well they act! how splendidly!” she said to her papa the police\\r\\ncaptain, every time the curtain fell. “How good Fenogenov is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if her papa had been capable of reading faces he would have read\\r\\non his daughter’s pale little countenance a rapture that was\\r\\nalmost anguish. She was overcome by the acting, by the play, by the\\r\\nsurroundings. When the regimental band began playing between the acts,\\r\\nshe closed her eyes, exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Papa!” she said to the police captain during the last interval, “go\\r\\nbehind the scenes and ask them all to dinner to-morrow!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police captain went behind the scenes, praised them for all their\\r\\nfine acting, and complimented Madame Beobahtov.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your lovely face demands a canvas, and I only wish I could wield the\\r\\nbrush!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with a scrape, he thereupon invited the company to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All except the fair sex,” he whispered. “I don’t want the actresses,\\r\\nfor I have a daughter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the actors dined at the police captain’s. Only three turned\\r\\nup, the manager Limonadov, the tragedian Fenogenov, and the comic\\r\\nman Vodolazov; the others sent excuses. The dinner was a dull affair.\\r\\nLimonadov kept telling the police captain how much he respected him, and\\r\\nhow highly he thought of all persons in authority; Vodolazov mimicked\\r\\ndrunken merchants and Armenians; and Fenogenov (on his passport his name\\r\\nwas Knish), a tall, stout Little Russian with black eyes and frowning\\r\\nbrow, declaimed “At the portals of the great,” and “To be or not to\\r\\nbe.” Limonadov, with tears in his eyes, described his interview with the\\r\\nformer Governor, General Kanyutchin. The police captain listened, was\\r\\nbored, and smiled affably. He was well satisfied, although Limonadov\\r\\nsmelt strongly of burnt feathers, and Fenogenov was wearing a hired\\r\\ndress coat and boots trodden down at heel. They pleased his daughter and\\r\\nmade her lively, and that was enough for him. And Masha never took her\\r\\neyes off the actors. She had never before seen such clever, exceptional\\r\\npeople!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening the police captain and Masha were at the theatre again.\\r\\nA week later the actors dined at the police captain’s again, and after\\r\\nthat came almost every day either to dinner or supper. Masha became more\\r\\nand more devoted to the theatre, and went there every evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fell in love with the tragedian. One fine morning, when the police\\r\\ncaptain had gone to meet the bishop, Masha ran away with Limonadov’s\\r\\ncompany and married her hero on the way. After celebrating the wedding,\\r\\nthe actors composed a long and touching letter and sent it to the police\\r\\ncaptain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the work of their combined efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bring out the motive, the motive!” Limonadov kept saying as he dictated\\r\\nto the comic man. “Lay on the respect.... These official chaps like\\r\\nit. Add something of a sort... to draw a tear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer to this letter was most discomforting. The police captain\\r\\ndisowned his daughter for marrying, as he said, “a stupid, idle Little\\r\\nRussian with no fixed home or occupation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the day after this answer was received Masha was writing to her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Papa, he beats me! Forgive us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had beaten her, beaten her behind the scenes, in the presence of\\r\\nLimonadov, the washerwoman, and two lighting men. He remembered how,\\r\\nfour days before the wedding, he was sitting in the London Tavern with\\r\\nthe whole company, and all were talking about Masha. The company were\\r\\nadvising him to “chance it,” and Limonadov, with tears in his\\r\\neyes urged: “It would be stupid and irrational to let slip such an\\r\\nopportunity! Why, for a sum like that one would go to Siberia, let alone\\r\\ngetting married! When you marry and have a theatre of your own, take me\\r\\ninto your company. I shan’t be master then, you’ll be master.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFenogenov remembered it, and muttered with clenched fists:\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he doesn’t send money I’ll smash her! I won’t let myself be made a\\r\\nfool of, damn my soul!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one provincial town the company tried to give Masha the slip, but\\r\\nMasha found out, ran to the station, and got there when the second bell\\r\\nhad rung and the actors had all taken their seats.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been shamefully treated by your father,” said the tragedian; “all\\r\\nis over between us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though the carriage was full of people, she went down on her knees\\r\\nand held out her hands, imploring him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I love you! Don’t drive me away, Kondraty Ivanovitch,” she besought\\r\\nhim. “I can’t live without you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey listened to her entreaties, and after consulting together, took\\r\\nher into the company as a “countess”--the name they used for the minor\\r\\nactresses who usually came on to the stage in crowds or in dumb parts.\\r\\nTo begin with Masha used to play maid-servants and pages, but when\\r\\nMadame Beobahtov, the flower of Limonadov’s company, eloped, they made\\r\\nher _ingenue_. She acted badly, lisped, and was nervous. She soon grew\\r\\nused to it, however, and began to be liked by the audience. Fenogenov\\r\\nwas much displeased.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To call her an actress!” he used to say. “She has no figure, no\\r\\ndeportment, nothing whatever but silliness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one provincial town the company acted Schiller’s “Robbers.”\\r\\n Fenogenov played Franz, Masha, Amalie. The tragedian shouted and\\r\\nquivered. Masha repeated her part like a well-learnt lesson, and the\\r\\nplay would have gone off as they generally did had it not been for\\r\\na trifling mishap. Everything went well up to the point where Franz\\r\\ndeclares his love for Amalie and she seizes his sword. The tragedian\\r\\nshouted, hissed, quivered, and squeezed Masha in his iron embrace. And\\r\\nMasha, instead of repulsing him and crying “Hence!” trembled in his\\r\\narms like a bird and did not move,... she seemed petrified.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have pity on me!” she whispered in his ear. “Oh, have pity on me! I am\\r\\nso miserable!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t know your part! Listen to the prompter!” hissed the\\r\\ntragedian, and he thrust his sword into her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the performance, Limonadov and Fenogenov were sitting in the\\r\\nticket box-office engaged in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your wife does not learn her part, you are right there,” the manager\\r\\nwas saying. “She doesn’t know her line.... Every man has his own\\r\\nline,... but she doesn’t know hers....”\\r\\n\\r\\nFenogenov listened, sighed, and scowled and scowled.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, Masha was sitting in a little general shop writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Papa, he beats me! Forgive us! Send us some money!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TRANSGRESSION\\r\\n\\r\\nA COLLEGIATE assessor called Miguev stopped at a telegraph-post in the\\r\\ncourse of his evening walk and heaved a deep sigh. A week before, as he\\r\\nwas returning home from his evening walk, he had been overtaken at that\\r\\nvery spot by his former housemaid, Agnia, who said to him viciously:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a bit! I’ll cook you such a crab that’ll teach you to ruin\\r\\ninnocent girls! I’ll leave the baby at your door, and I’ll have the law\\r\\nof you, and I’ll tell your wife, too....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she demanded that he should put five thousand roubles into the\\r\\nbank in her name. Miguev remembered it, heaved a sigh, and once\\r\\nmore reproached himself with heartfelt repentance for the momentary\\r\\ninfatuation which had caused him so much worry and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he reached his bungalow, he sat down to rest on the doorstep. It\\r\\nwas just ten o’clock, and a bit of the moon peeped out from behind\\r\\nthe clouds. There was not a soul in the street nor near the bungalows;\\r\\nelderly summer visitors were already going to bed, while young ones were\\r\\nwalking in the wood. Feeling in both his pockets for a match to light\\r\\nhis cigarette, Miguev brought his elbow into contact with something\\r\\nsoft. He looked idly at his right elbow, and his face was instantly\\r\\ncontorted by a look of as much horror as though he had seen a snake\\r\\nbeside him. On the step at the very door lay a bundle. Something oblong\\r\\nin shape was wrapped up in something--judging by the feel of it,\\r\\na wadded quilt. One end of the bundle was a little open, and the\\r\\ncollegiate assessor, putting in his hand, felt something damp and warm.\\r\\nHe leaped on to his feet in horror, and looked about him like a criminal\\r\\ntrying to escape from his warders....\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has left it!” he muttered wrathfully through his teeth, clenching\\r\\nhis fists. “Here it lies.... Here lies my transgression! O Lord!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was numb with terror, anger, and shame... What was he to do now?\\r\\nWhat would his wife say if she found out? What would his colleagues at\\r\\nthe office say? His Excellency would be sure to dig him in the ribs,\\r\\nguffaw, and say: “I congratulate you!... He-he-he! Though your beard\\r\\nis gray, your heart is gay.... You are a rogue, Semyon Erastovitch!”\\r\\n The whole colony of summer visitors would know his secret now, and\\r\\nprobably the respectable mothers of families would shut their doors to\\r\\nhim. Such incidents always get into the papers, and the humble name of\\r\\nMiguev would be published all over Russia....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle window of the bungalow was open and he could distinctly hear\\r\\nhis wife, Anna Filippovna, laying the table for supper; in the yard\\r\\nclose to the gate Yermolay, the porter, was plaintively strumming on the\\r\\nbalalaika. The baby had only to wake up and begin to cry, and the secret\\r\\nwould be discovered. Miguev was conscious of an overwhelming desire to\\r\\nmake haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haste, haste!...” he muttered, “this minute, before anyone sees.\\r\\nI’ll carry it away and lay it on somebody’s doorstep....”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiguev took the bundle in one hand and quietly, with a deliberate step\\r\\nto avoid awakening suspicion, went down the street....\\r\\n\\r\\n“A wonderfully nasty position!” he reflected, trying to assume an air of\\r\\nunconcern. “A collegiate assessor walking down the street with a baby!\\r\\nGood heavens! if anyone sees me and understands the position, I am\\r\\ndone for.... I’d better put it on this doorstep.... No, stay, the\\r\\nwindows are open and perhaps someone is looking. Where shall I put it?\\r\\nI know! I’ll take it to the merchant Myelkin’s.... Merchants are rich\\r\\npeople and tenderhearted; very likely they will say thank you and adopt\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Miguev made up his mind to take the baby to Myelkin’s, although the\\r\\nmerchant’s villa was in the furthest street, close to the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If only it does not begin screaming or wriggle out of the bundle,”\\r\\n thought the collegiate assessor. “This is indeed a pleasant surprise!\\r\\nHere I am carrying a human being under my arm as though it were a\\r\\nportfolio. A human being, alive, with soul, with feelings like anyone\\r\\nelse.... If by good luck the Myelkins adopt him, he may turn out\\r\\nsomebody.... Maybe he will become a professor, a great general, an\\r\\nauthor.... Anything may happen! Now I am carrying him under my arm\\r\\nlike a bundle of rubbish, and perhaps in thirty or forty years I may not\\r\\ndare to sit down in his presence....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Miguev was walking along a narrow, deserted alley, beside a long\\r\\nrow of fences, in the thick black shade of the lime trees, it suddenly\\r\\nstruck him that he was doing something very cruel and criminal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How mean it is really!” he thought. “So mean that one can’t imagine\\r\\nanything meaner.... Why are we shifting this poor baby from door to\\r\\ndoor? It’s not its fault that it’s been born. It’s done us no harm. We\\r\\nare scoundrels.... We take our pleasure, and the innocent babies have\\r\\nto pay the penalty. Only to think of all this wretched business! I’ve\\r\\ndone wrong and the child has a cruel fate before it. If I lay it at the\\r\\nMyelkins’ door, they’ll send it to the foundling hospital, and there it\\r\\nwill grow up among strangers, in mechanical routine,... no love,\\r\\nno petting, no spoiling.... And then he’ll be apprenticed to a\\r\\nshoemaker,... he’ll take to drink, will learn to use filthy language,\\r\\nwill go hungry. A shoemaker! and he the son of a collegiate assessor, of\\r\\ngood family.... He is my flesh and blood,... ”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiguev came out of the shade of the lime trees into the bright moonlight\\r\\nof the open road, and opening the bundle, he looked at the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Asleep!” he murmured. “You little rascal! why, you’ve an aquiline nose\\r\\nlike your father’s.... He sleeps and doesn’t feel that it’s his own\\r\\nfather looking at him!... It’s a drama, my boy... Well, well, you\\r\\nmust forgive me. Forgive me, old boy.... It seems it’s your fate....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collegiate assessor blinked and felt a spasm running down his\\r\\ncheeks.... He wrapped up the baby, put him under his arm, and strode\\r\\non. All the way to the Myelkins’ villa social questions were swarming in\\r\\nhis brain and conscience was gnawing in his bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I were a decent, honest man,” he thought, “I should damn everything,\\r\\ngo with this baby to Anna Filippovna, fall on my knees before her,\\r\\nand say: ‘Forgive me! I have sinned! Torture me, but we won’t ruin an\\r\\ninnocent child. We have no children; let us adopt him!’ She’s a good\\r\\nsort, she’d consent.... And then my child would be with me....\\r\\nEch!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reached the Myelkins’ villa and stood still hesitating. He imagined\\r\\nhimself in the parlor at home, sitting reading the paper while a little\\r\\nboy with an aquiline nose played with the tassels of his dressing gown.\\r\\nAt the same time visions forced themselves on his brain of his winking\\r\\ncolleagues, and of his Excellency digging him in the ribs and\\r\\nguffawing.... Besides the pricking of his conscience, there was\\r\\nsomething warm, sad, and tender in his heart....\\r\\n\\r\\nCautiously the collegiate assessor laid the baby on the verandah step\\r\\nand waved his hand. Again he felt a spasm run over his face....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forgive me, old fellow! I am a scoundrel,” he muttered. “Don’t remember\\r\\nevil against me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped back, but immediately cleared his throat resolutely and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come what will! Damn it all! I’ll take him, and let people say what\\r\\nthey like!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiguev took the baby and strode rapidly back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let them say what they like,” he thought. “I’ll go at once, fall on\\r\\nmy knees, and say: ‘Anna Filippovna!’ Anna is a good sort, she’ll\\r\\nunderstand.... And we’ll bring him up.... If it’s a boy we’ll call\\r\\nhim Vladimir, and if it’s a girl we’ll call her Anna! Anyway, it will be\\r\\na comfort in our old age.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he did as he determined. Weeping and almost faint with shame and\\r\\nterror, full of hope and vague rapture, he went into his bungalow, went\\r\\nup to his wife, and fell on his knees before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anna Filippovna!” he said with a sob, and he laid the baby on the\\r\\nfloor. “Hear me before you punish.... I have sinned! This is my\\r\\nchild.... You remember Agnia? Well, it was the devil drove me to it.\\r\\n...”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, almost unconscious with shame and terror, he jumped up without\\r\\nwaiting for an answer, and ran out into the open air as though he had\\r\\nreceived a thrashing....\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll stay here outside till she calls me,” he thought. “I’ll give her\\r\\ntime to recover, and to think it over....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter Yermolay passed him with his balalaika, glanced at him and\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders. A minute later he passed him again, and again he\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s a go! Did you ever!” he muttered grinning. “Aksinya, the\\r\\nwasher-woman, was here just now, Semyon Erastovitch. The silly woman\\r\\nput her baby down on the steps here, and while she was indoors with me,\\r\\nsomeone took and carried off the baby... Who’d have thought it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? What are you saying?” shouted Miguev at the top of his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nYermolay, interpreting his master’s wrath in his own fashion, scratched\\r\\nhis head and heaved a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry, Semyon Erastovitch,” he said, “but it’s the summer\\r\\nholidays,... one can’t get on without... without a woman, I mean....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd glancing at his master’s eyes glaring at him with anger and\\r\\nastonishment, he cleared his throat guiltily and went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a sin, of course, but there--what is one to do?... You’ve\\r\\nforbidden us to have strangers in the house, I know, but we’ve none of\\r\\nour own now. When Agnia was here I had no women to see me, for I had one\\r\\nat home; but now, you can see for yourself, sir,... one can’t\\r\\nhelp having strangers. In Agnia’s time, of course, there was nothing\\r\\nirregular, because...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be off, you scoundrel!” Miguev shouted at him, stamping, and he went\\r\\nback into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna Filippovna, amazed and wrathful, was sitting as before, her\\r\\ntear-stained eyes fixed on the baby....\\r\\n\\r\\n“There! there!” Miguev muttered with a pale face, twisting his lips\\r\\ninto a smile. “It was a joke.... It’s not my baby,... it’s\\r\\nthe washer-woman’s!... I... I was joking.... Take it to the\\r\\nporter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSMALL FRY\\r\\n\\r\\n“HONORED Sir, Father and Benefactor!” a petty clerk called Nevyrazimov\\r\\nwas writing a rough copy of an Easter congratulatory letter. “I trust\\r\\nthat you may spend this Holy Day even as many more to come, in good\\r\\nhealth and prosperity. And to your family also I...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lamp, in which the kerosene was getting low, was smoking and\\r\\nsmelling. A stray cockroach was running about the table in alarm near\\r\\nNevyrazimov’s writing hand. Two rooms away from the office Paramon the\\r\\nporter was for the third time cleaning his best boots, and with such\\r\\nenergy that the sound of the blacking-brush and of his expectorations\\r\\nwas audible in all the rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else can I write to him, the rascal?” Nevyrazimov wondered,\\r\\nraising his eyes to the smutty ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the ceiling he saw a dark circle--the shadow of the lamp-shade. Below\\r\\nit was the dusty cornice, and lower still the wall, which had once been\\r\\npainted a bluish muddy color. And the office seemed to him such a place\\r\\nof desolation that he felt sorry, not only for himself, but even for the\\r\\ncockroach.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I am off duty I shall go away, but he’ll be on duty here all his\\r\\ncockroach-life,” he thought, stretching. “I am bored! Shall I clean my\\r\\nboots?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd stretching once more, Nevyrazimov slouched lazily to the porter’s\\r\\nroom. Paramon had finished cleaning his boots. Crossing himself with\\r\\none hand and holding the brush in the other, he was standing at the open\\r\\nwindow-pane, listening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re ringing,” he whispered to Nevyrazimov, looking at him with eyes\\r\\nintent and wide open. “Already!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNevyrazimov put his ear to the open pane and listened. The Easter chimes\\r\\nfloated into the room with a whiff of fresh spring air. The booming of\\r\\nthe bells mingled with the rumble of carriages, and above the chaos\\r\\nof sounds rose the brisk tenor tones of the nearest church and a loud\\r\\nshrill laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a lot of people!” sighed Nevyrazimov, looking down into\\r\\nthe street, where shadows of men flitted one after another by the\\r\\nillumination lamps. “They’re all hurrying to the midnight service....\\r\\nOur fellows have had a drink by now, you may be sure, and are strolling\\r\\nabout the town. What a lot of laughter, what a lot of talk! I’m the\\r\\nonly unlucky one, to have to sit here on such a day: And I have to do it\\r\\nevery year!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, nobody forces you to take the job. It’s not your turn to be on\\r\\nduty today, but Zastupov hired you to take his place. When other folks\\r\\nare enjoying themselves you hire yourself out. It’s greediness!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Devil a bit of it! Not much to be greedy over--two roubles is all he\\r\\ngives me; a necktie as an extra.... It’s poverty, not greediness.\\r\\nAnd it would be jolly, now, you know, to be going with a party to the\\r\\nservice, and then to break the fast.... To drink and to have a bit\\r\\nof supper and tumble off to sleep.... One sits down to the table,\\r\\nthere’s an Easter cake and the samovar hissing, and some charming little\\r\\nthing beside you.... You drink a glass and chuck her under the chin,\\r\\nand it’s first-rate.... You feel you’re somebody.... Ech h-h!...\\r\\nI’ve made a mess of things! Look at that hussy driving by in her\\r\\ncarriage, while I have to sit here and brood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We each have our lot in life, Ivan Danilitch. Please God, you’ll be\\r\\npromoted and drive about in your carriage one day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I? No, brother, not likely. I shan’t get beyond a ‘titular,’ not if I\\r\\ntry till I burst. I’m not an educated man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our General has no education either, but...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, but the General stole a hundred thousand before he got his\\r\\nposition. And he’s got very different manners and deportment from me,\\r\\nbrother. With my manners and deportment one can’t get far! And such a\\r\\nscoundrelly surname, Nevyrazimov! It’s a hopeless position, in fact. One\\r\\nmay go on as one is, or one may hang oneself...”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved away from the window and walked wearily about the rooms. The\\r\\ndin of the bells grew louder and louder.... There was no need to\\r\\nstand by the window to hear it. And the better he could hear the bells\\r\\nand the louder the roar of the carriages, the darker seemed the muddy\\r\\nwalls and the smutty cornice and the more the lamp smoked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I hook it and leave the office?” thought Nevyrazimov.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut such a flight promised nothing worth having.... After coming out\\r\\nof the office and wandering about the town, Nevyrazimov would have gone\\r\\nhome to his lodging, and in his lodging it was even grayer and more\\r\\ndepressing than in the office.... Even supposing he were to spend\\r\\nthat day pleasantly and with comfort, what had he beyond? Nothing but\\r\\nthe same gray walls, the same stop-gap duty and complimentary\\r\\nletters....\\r\\n\\r\\nNevyrazimov stood still in the middle of the office and sank into\\r\\nthought. The yearning for a new, better life gnawed at his heart with an\\r\\nintolerable ache. He had a passionate longing to find himself suddenly\\r\\nin the street, to mingle with the living crowd, to take part in the\\r\\nsolemn festivity for the sake of which all those bells were clashing\\r\\nand those carriages were rumbling. He longed for what he had known in\\r\\nchildhood--the family circle, the festive faces of his own people, the\\r\\nwhite cloth, light, warmth...! He thought of the carriage in which\\r\\nthe lady had just driven by, the overcoat in which the head clerk was\\r\\nso smart, the gold chain that adorned the secretary’s chest....\\r\\nHe thought of a warm bed, of the Stanislav order, of new boots, of\\r\\na uniform without holes in the elbows.... He thought of all those\\r\\nthings because he had none of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I steal?” he thought. “Even if stealing is an easy matter,\\r\\nhiding is what’s difficult. Men run away to America, they say, with what\\r\\nthey’ve stolen, but the devil knows where that blessed America is. One\\r\\nmust have education even to steal, it seems.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bells died down. He heard only a distant noise of carriages and\\r\\nParamon’s cough, while his depression and anger grew more and more\\r\\nintense and unbearable. The clock in the office struck half-past twelve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I write a secret report? Proshkin did, and he rose rapidly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNevyrazimov sat down at his table and pondered. The lamp in which the\\r\\nkerosene had quite run dry was smoking violently and threatening to go\\r\\nout. The stray cockroach was still running about the table and had found\\r\\nno resting-place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One can always send in a secret report, but how is one to make it up?\\r\\nI should want to make all sorts of innuendoes and insinuations, like\\r\\nProshkin, and I can’t do it. If I made up anything I should be the first\\r\\nto get into trouble for it. I’m an ass, damn my soul!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Nevyrazimov, racking his brain for a means of escape from his\\r\\nhopeless position, stared at the rough copy he had written. The letter\\r\\nwas written to a man whom he feared and hated with his whole soul, and\\r\\nfrom whom he had for the last ten years been trying to wring a post\\r\\nworth eighteen roubles a month, instead of the one he had at sixteen\\r\\nroubles.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I’ll teach you to run here, you devil!” He viciously slapped the\\r\\npalm of his hand on the cockroach, who had the misfortune to catch his\\r\\neye. “Nasty thing!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cockroach fell on its back and wriggled its legs in despair.\\r\\nNevyrazimov took it by one leg and threw it into the lamp. The lamp\\r\\nflared up and spluttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Nevyrazimov felt better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE REQUIEM\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the village church of Verhny Zaprudy mass was just over. The people\\r\\nhad begun moving and were trooping out of church. The only one who\\r\\ndid not move was Andrey Andreyitch, a shopkeeper and old inhabitant of\\r\\nVerhny Zaprudy. He stood waiting, with his elbows on the railing of the\\r\\nright choir. His fat and shaven face, covered with indentations left\\r\\nby pimples, expressed on this occasion two contradictory feelings:\\r\\nresignation in the face of inevitable destiny, and stupid, unbounded\\r\\ndisdain for the smocks and striped kerchiefs passing by him. As it was\\r\\nSunday, he was dressed like a dandy. He wore a long cloth overcoat with\\r\\nyellow bone buttons, blue trousers not thrust into his boots, and sturdy\\r\\ngoloshes--the huge clumsy goloshes only seen on the feet of practical\\r\\nand prudent persons of firm religious convictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis torpid eyes, sunk in fat, were fixed upon the ikon stand. He saw the\\r\\nlong familiar figures of the saints, the verger Matvey puffing out his\\r\\ncheeks and blowing out the candles, the darkened candle stands, the\\r\\nthreadbare carpet, the sacristan Lopuhov running impulsively from the\\r\\naltar and carrying the holy bread to the churchwarden.... All these\\r\\nthings he had seen for years, and seen over and over again like the five\\r\\nfingers of his hand.... There was only one thing, however, that was\\r\\nsomewhat strange and unusual. Father Grigory, still in his vestments,\\r\\nwas standing at the north door, twitching his thick eyebrows angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is it he is winking at? God bless him!” thought the shopkeeper.\\r\\n“And he is beckoning with his finger! And he stamped his foot! What\\r\\nnext! What’s the matter, Holy Queen and Mother! Whom does he mean it\\r\\nfor?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrey Andreyitch looked round and saw the church completely deserted.\\r\\nThere were some ten people standing at the door, but they had their\\r\\nbacks to the altar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do come when you are called! Why do you stand like a graven image?” he\\r\\nheard Father Grigory’s angry voice. “I am calling you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper looked at Father Grigory’s red and wrathful face, and\\r\\nonly then realized that the twitching eyebrows and beckoning finger\\r\\nmight refer to him. He started, left the railing, and hesitatingly\\r\\nwalked towards the altar, tramping with his heavy goloshes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Andrey Andreyitch, was it you asked for prayers for the rest of\\r\\nMariya’s soul?” asked the priest, his eyes angrily transfixing the\\r\\nshopkeeper’s fat, perspiring face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it was you wrote this? You?” And Father Grigory angrily thrust\\r\\nbefore his eyes the little note.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on this little note, handed in by Andrey Andreyitch before mass, was\\r\\nwritten in big, as it were staggering, letters:\\r\\n\\r\\n“For the rest of the soul of the servant of God, the harlot Mariya.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, certainly I wrote it,...” answered the shopkeeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How dared you write it?” whispered the priest, and in his husky whisper\\r\\nthere was a note of wrath and alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper looked at him in blank amazement; he was perplexed, and\\r\\nhe, too, was alarmed. Father Grigory had never in his life spoken in\\r\\nsuch a tone to a leading resident of Verhny Zaprudy. Both were silent\\r\\nfor a minute, staring into each other’s face. The shopkeeper’s amazement\\r\\nwas so great that his fat face spread in all directions like spilt\\r\\ndough.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How dared you?” repeated the priest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wha... what?” asked Andrey Andreyitch in bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t understand?” whispered Father Grigory, stepping back\\r\\nin astonishment and clasping his hands. “What have you got on your\\r\\nshoulders, a head or some other object? You send a note up to the altar,\\r\\nand write a word in it which it would be unseemly even to utter in the\\r\\nstreet! Why are you rolling your eyes? Surely you know the meaning of\\r\\nthe word?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you referring to the word harlot?” muttered the shopkeeper,\\r\\nflushing crimson and blinking. “But you know, the Lord in His mercy...\\r\\nforgave this very thing,... forgave a harlot.... He has prepared\\r\\na place for her, and indeed from the life of the holy saint, Mariya of\\r\\nEgypt, one may see in what sense the word is used--excuse me...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper wanted to bring forward some other argument in his\\r\\njustification, but took fright and wiped his lips with his sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that’s what you make of it!” cried Father Grigory, clasping his\\r\\nhands. “But you see God has forgiven her--do you understand? He has\\r\\nforgiven, but you judge her, you slander her, call her by an unseemly\\r\\nname, and whom! Your own deceased daughter! Not only in Holy Scripture,\\r\\nbut even in worldly literature you won’t read of such a sin! I tell\\r\\nyou again, Andrey, you mustn’t be over-subtle! No, no, you mustn’t be\\r\\nover-subtle, brother! If God has given you an inquiring mind, and if you\\r\\ncannot direct it, better not go into things.... Don’t go into things,\\r\\nand hold your peace!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you know, she,... excuse my mentioning it, was an actress!”\\r\\n articulated Andrey Andreyitch, overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An actress! But whatever she was, you ought to forget it all now she is\\r\\ndead, instead of writing it on the note.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just so,...” the shopkeeper assented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to do penance,” boomed the deacon from the depths of the\\r\\naltar, looking contemptuously at Andrey Andreyitch’s embarrassed face,\\r\\n“that would teach you to leave off being so clever! Your daughter was\\r\\na well-known actress. There were even notices of her death in the\\r\\nnewspapers.... Philosopher!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To be sure,... certainly,” muttered the shopkeeper, “the word is not\\r\\na seemly one; but I did not say it to judge her, Father Grigory, I only\\r\\nmeant to speak spiritually,... that it might be clearer to you for\\r\\nwhom you were praying. They write in the memorial notes the various\\r\\ncallings, such as the infant John, the drowned woman Pelagea, the\\r\\nwarrior Yegor, the murdered Pavel, and so on.... I meant to do the\\r\\nsame.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was foolish, Andrey! God will forgive you, but beware another time.\\r\\nAbove all, don’t be subtle, but think like other people. Make ten bows\\r\\nand go your way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I obey,” said the shopkeeper, relieved that the lecture was over, and\\r\\nallowing his face to resume its expression of importance and dignity.\\r\\n“Ten bows? Very good, I understand. But now, Father, allow me to ask\\r\\nyou a favor.... Seeing that I am, anyway, her father,... you know\\r\\nyourself, whatever she was, she was still my daughter, so I was,...\\r\\nexcuse me, meaning to ask you to sing the requiem today. And allow me to\\r\\nask you, Father Deacon!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s good,” said Father Grigory, taking off his vestments.\\r\\n“That I commend. I can approve of that! Well, go your way. We will come\\r\\nout immediately.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrey Andreyitch walked with dignity from the altar, and with a solemn,\\r\\nrequiem-like expression on his red face took his stand in the middle\\r\\nof the church. The verger Matvey set before him a little table with the\\r\\nmemorial food upon it, and a little later the requiem service began.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was perfect stillness in the church. Nothing could be heard but\\r\\nthe metallic click of the censer and slow singing.... Near Andrey\\r\\nAndreyitch stood the verger Matvey, the midwife Makaryevna, and her\\r\\none-armed son Mitka. There was no one else. The sacristan sang badly in\\r\\nan unpleasant, hollow bass, but the tune and the words were so mournful\\r\\nthat the shopkeeper little by little lost the expression of dignity and\\r\\nwas plunged in sadness. He thought of his Mashutka,... he remembered\\r\\nshe had been born when he was still a lackey in the service of the owner\\r\\nof Verhny Zaprudy. In his busy life as a lackey he had not noticed\\r\\nhow his girl had grown up. That long period during which she was being\\r\\nshaped into a graceful creature, with a little flaxen head and dreamy\\r\\neyes as big as kopeck-pieces passed unnoticed by him. She had been\\r\\nbrought up like all the children of favorite lackeys, in ease and\\r\\ncomfort in the company of the young ladies. The gentry, to fill up their\\r\\nidle time, had taught her to read, to write, to dance; he had had no\\r\\nhand in her bringing up. Only from time to time casually meeting her at\\r\\nthe gate or on the landing of the stairs, he would remember that she was\\r\\nhis daughter, and would, so far as he had leisure for it, begin teaching\\r\\nher the prayers and the scripture. Oh, even then he had the reputation\\r\\nof an authority on the church rules and the holy scriptures! Forbidding\\r\\nand stolid as her father’s face was, yet the girl listened readily. She\\r\\nrepeated the prayers after him yawning, but on the other hand, when he,\\r\\nhesitating and trying to express himself elaborately, began telling her\\r\\nstories, she was all attention. Esau’s pottage, the punishment of Sodom,\\r\\nand the troubles of the boy Joseph made her turn pale and open her blue\\r\\neyes wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards when he gave up being a lackey, and with the money he had\\r\\nsaved opened a shop in the village, Mashutka had gone away to Moscow\\r\\nwith his master’s family....\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years before her death she had come to see her father. He had\\r\\nscarcely recognized her. She was a graceful young woman with the manners\\r\\nof a young lady, and dressed like one. She talked cleverly, as though\\r\\nfrom a book, smoked, and slept till midday. When Andrey Andreyitch asked\\r\\nher what she was doing, she had announced, looking him boldly straight\\r\\nin the face: “I am an actress.” Such frankness struck the former flunkey\\r\\nas the acme of cynicism. Mashutka had begun boasting of her successes\\r\\nand her stage life; but seeing that her father only turned crimson and\\r\\nthrew up his hands, she ceased. And they spent a fortnight together\\r\\nwithout speaking or looking at one another till the day she went away.\\r\\nBefore she went away she asked her father to come for a walk on the bank\\r\\nof the river. Painful as it was for him to walk in the light of day, in\\r\\nthe sight of all honest people, with a daughter who was an actress, he\\r\\nyielded to her request.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a lovely place you live in!” she said enthusiastically. “What\\r\\nravines and marshes! Good heavens, how lovely my native place is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she had burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The place is simply taking up room,...” Andrey Andreyvitch\\r\\nhad thought, looking blankly at the ravines, not understanding his\\r\\ndaughter’s enthusiasm. “There is no more profit from them than milk from\\r\\na billy-goat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she had cried and cried, drawing her breath greedily with her whole\\r\\nchest, as though she felt she had not a long time left to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrey Andreyitch shook his head like a horse that has been bitten, and\\r\\nto stifle painful memories began rapidly crossing himself....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be mindful, O Lord,” he muttered, “of Thy departed servant, the harlot\\r\\nMariya, and forgive her sins, voluntary or involuntary....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unseemly word dropped from his lips again, but he did not notice\\r\\nit: what is firmly imbedded in the consciousness cannot be driven out by\\r\\nFather Grigory’s exhortations or even knocked out by a nail. Makaryevna\\r\\nsighed and whispered something, drawing in a deep breath, while\\r\\none-armed Mitka was brooding over something....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where there is no sickness, nor grief, nor sighing,” droned the\\r\\nsacristan, covering his right cheek with his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBluish smoke coiled up from the censer and bathed in the broad, slanting\\r\\npatch of sunshine which cut across the gloomy, lifeless emptiness of the\\r\\nchurch. And it seemed as though the soul of the dead woman were soaring\\r\\ninto the sunlight together with the smoke. The coils of smoke like a\\r\\nchild’s curls eddied round and round, floating upwards to the window\\r\\nand, as it were, holding aloof from the woes and tribulations of which\\r\\nthat poor soul was full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN THE COACH-HOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nIT was between nine and ten o’clock in the evening. Stepan the coachman,\\r\\nMihailo the house-porter, Alyoshka the coachman’s grandson, who had come\\r\\nup from the village to stay with his grandfather, and Nikandr, an old\\r\\nman of seventy, who used to come into the yard every evening to sell\\r\\nsalt herrings, were sitting round a lantern in the big coach-house,\\r\\nplaying “kings.” Through the wide-open door could be seen the whole\\r\\nyard, the big house, where the master’s family lived, the gates, the\\r\\ncellars, and the porter’s lodge. It was all shrouded in the darkness of\\r\\nnight, and only the four windows of one of the lodges which was let\\r\\nwere brightly lit up. The shadows of the coaches and sledges with their\\r\\nshafts tipped upwards stretched from the walls to the doors, quivering\\r\\nand cutting across the shadows cast by the lantern and the players....\\r\\nOn the other side of the thin partition that divided the coach-house\\r\\nfrom the stable were the horses. There was a scent of hay, and a\\r\\ndisagreeable smell of salt herrings coming from old Nikandr.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter won and was king; he assumed an attitude such as was in his\\r\\nopinion befitting a king, and blew his nose loudly on a red-checked\\r\\nhandkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now if I like I can chop off anybody’s head,” he said. Alyoshka, a\\r\\nboy of eight with a head of flaxen hair, left long uncut, who had only\\r\\nmissed being king by two tricks, looked angrily and with envy at the\\r\\nporter. He pouted and frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall give you the trick, grandfather,” he said, pondering over his\\r\\ncards; “I know you have got the queen of diamonds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, little silly, you have thought enough!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlyoshka timidly played the knave of diamonds. At that moment a ring was\\r\\nheard from the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, hang you!” muttered the porter, getting up. “Go and open the gate,\\r\\nO king!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came back a little later, Alyoshka was already a prince, the\\r\\nfish-hawker a soldier, and the coachman a peasant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a nasty business,” said the porter, sitting down to the cards\\r\\nagain. “I have just let the doctors out. They have not extracted it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could they? Just think, they would have to pick open the brains. If\\r\\nthere is a bullet in the head, of what use are doctors?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is lying unconscious,” the porter went on. “He is bound to die.\\r\\nAlyoshka, don’t look at the cards, you little puppy, or I will pull your\\r\\nears! Yes, I let the doctors out, and the father and mother in... They\\r\\nhave only just arrived. Such crying and wailing, Lord preserve us! They\\r\\nsay he is the only son.... It’s a grief!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll except Alyoshka, who was absorbed in the game, looked round at the\\r\\nbrightly lighted windows of the lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have orders to go to the police station tomorrow,” said the porter.\\r\\n“There will be an inquiry... But what do I know about it? I saw\\r\\nnothing of it. He called me this morning, gave me a letter, and said:\\r\\n‘Put it in the letter-box for me.’ And his eyes were red with crying.\\r\\nHis wife and children were not at home. They had gone out for a walk. So\\r\\nwhen I had gone with the letter, he put a bullet into his forehead from\\r\\na revolver. When I came back his cook was wailing for the whole yard to\\r\\nhear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a great sin,” said the fish-hawker in a husky voice, and he shook\\r\\nhis head, “a great sin!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From too much learning,” said the porter, taking a trick; “his wits\\r\\noutstripped his wisdom. Sometimes he would sit writing papers all\\r\\nnight.... Play, peasant!... But he was a nice gentleman. And so white\\r\\nskinned, black-haired and tall!... He was a good lodger.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems the fair sex is at the bottom of it,” said the coachman,\\r\\nslapping the nine of trumps on the king of diamonds. “It seems he was\\r\\nfond of another man’s wife and disliked his own; it does happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The king rebels,” said the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment there was again a ring from the yard. The rebellious king\\r\\nspat with vexation and went out. Shadows like dancing couples flitted\\r\\nacross the windows of the lodge. There was the sound of voices and\\r\\nhurried footsteps in the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose the doctors have come again,” said the coachman. “Our Mihailo\\r\\nis run off his legs....”\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange wailing voice rang out for a moment in the air. Alyoshka\\r\\nlooked in alarm at his grandfather, the coachman; then at the windows,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“He stroked me on the head at the gate yesterday, and said, ‘What\\r\\ndistrict do you come from, boy?’ Grandfather, who was that howled just\\r\\nnow?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis grandfather trimmed the light in the lantern and made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man is lost,” he said a little later, with a yawn. “He is lost, and\\r\\nhis children are ruined, too. It’s a disgrace for his children for the\\r\\nrest of their lives now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe porter came back and sat down by the lantern.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is dead,” he said. “They have sent to the almshouse for the old\\r\\nwomen to lay him out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The kingdom of heaven and eternal peace to him!” whispered the\\r\\ncoachman, and he crossed himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at him, Alyoshka crossed himself too.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t pray for such as him,” said the fish-hawker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a sin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s true,” the porter assented. “Now his soul has gone straight to\\r\\nhell, to the devil....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a sin,” repeated the fish-hawker; “such as he have no funeral, no\\r\\nrequiem, but are buried like carrion with no respect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man put on his cap and got up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was the same thing at our lady’s,” he said, pulling his cap on\\r\\nfurther. “We were serfs in those days; the younger son of our mistress,\\r\\nthe General’s lady, shot himself through the mouth with a pistol, from\\r\\ntoo much learning, too. It seems that by law such have to be buried\\r\\noutside the cemetery, without priests, without a requiem service; but to\\r\\nsave disgrace our lady, you know, bribed the police and the doctors,\\r\\nand they gave her a paper to say her son had done it when delirious, not\\r\\nknowing what he was doing. You can do anything with money. So he had\\r\\na funeral with priests and every honor, the music played, and he was\\r\\nburied in the church; for the deceased General had built that church\\r\\nwith his own money, and all his family were buried there. Only this is\\r\\nwhat happened, friends. One month passed, and then another, and it was\\r\\nall right. In the third month they informed the General’s lady that the\\r\\nwatchmen had come from that same church. What did they want? They were\\r\\nbrought to her, they fell at her feet. ‘We can’t go on serving, your\\r\\nexcellency,’ they said. ‘Look out for other watchmen and graciously\\r\\ndismiss us.’ ‘What for?’ ‘No,’ they said, ‘we can’t possibly; your son\\r\\nhowls under the church all night.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlyoshka shuddered, and pressed his face to the coachman’s back so as\\r\\nnot to see the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At first the General’s lady would not listen,” continued the old man.\\r\\n“‘All this is your fancy, you simple folk have such notions,’ she said.\\r\\n‘A dead man cannot howl.’ Some time afterwards the watchmen came to her\\r\\nagain, and with them the sacristan. So the sacristan, too, had heard\\r\\nhim howling. The General’s lady saw that it was a bad job; she locked\\r\\nherself in her bedroom with the watchmen. ‘Here, my friends, here are\\r\\ntwenty-five roubles for you, and for that go by night in secret, so that\\r\\nno one should hear or see you, dig up my unhappy son, and bury him,’ she\\r\\nsaid, ‘outside the cemetery.’ And I suppose she stood them a glass...\\r\\nAnd the watchmen did so. The stone with the inscription on it is there\\r\\nto this day, but he himself, the General’s son, is outside the\\r\\ncemetery.... O Lord, forgive us our transgressions!” sighed the\\r\\nfish-hawker. “There is only one day in the year when one may pray for\\r\\nsuch people: the Saturday before Trinity.... You mustn’t give alms to\\r\\nbeggars for their sake, it is a sin, but you may feed the birds for the\\r\\nrest of their souls. The General’s lady used to go out to the crossroads\\r\\nevery three days to feed the birds. Once at the cross-roads a black dog\\r\\nsuddenly appeared; it ran up to the bread, and was such a... we all know\\r\\nwhat that dog was. The General’s lady was like a half-crazy creature for\\r\\nfive days afterwards, she neither ate nor drank.... All at once she fell\\r\\non her knees in the garden, and prayed and prayed.... Well, good-by,\\r\\nfriends, the blessing of God and the Heavenly Mother be with you. Let us\\r\\ngo, Mihailo, you’ll open the gate for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fish-hawker and the porter went out. The coachman and Alyoshka went\\r\\nout too, so as not to be left in the coach-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man was living and is dead!” said the coachman, looking towards the\\r\\nwindows where shadows were still flitting to and fro. “Only this morning\\r\\nhe was walking about the yard, and now he is lying dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The time will come and we shall die too,” said the porter, walking away\\r\\nwith the fish-hawker, and at once they both vanished from sight in the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman, and Alyoshka after him, somewhat timidly went up to the\\r\\nlighted windows. A very pale lady with large tear stained eyes, and a\\r\\nfine-looking gray headed man were moving two card-tables into the middle\\r\\nof the room, probably with the intention of laying the dead man upon\\r\\nthem, and on the green cloth of the table numbers could still be seen\\r\\nwritten in chalk. The cook who had run about the yard wailing in the\\r\\nmorning was now standing on a chair, stretching up to try and cover the\\r\\nlooking glass with a towel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grandfather what are they doing?” asked Alyoshka in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are just going to lay him on the tables,” answered his\\r\\ngrandfather. “Let us go, child, it is bedtime.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman and Alyoshka went back to the coach-house. They said their\\r\\nprayers, and took off their boots. Stepan lay down in a corner on the\\r\\nfloor, Alyoshka in a sledge. The doors of the coach house were shut,\\r\\nthere was a horrible stench from the extinguished lantern. A little\\r\\nlater Alyoshka sat up and looked about him; through the crack of the\\r\\ndoor he could still see a light from those lighted windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grandfather, I am frightened!” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, go to sleep, go to sleep!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you I am frightened!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you frightened of? What a baby!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlyoshka suddenly jumped out of the sledge and, loudly weeping, ran to\\r\\nhis grandfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it? What’s the matter?” cried the coachman in a fright, getting\\r\\nup also.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s howling!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is howling?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am frightened, grandfather, do you hear?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s their crying,” he said. “Come! there, little silly! They are sad,\\r\\nso they are crying.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to go home,...” his grandson went on sobbing and trembling\\r\\nall over. “Grandfather, let us go back to the village, to mammy; come,\\r\\ngrandfather dear, God will give you the heavenly kingdom for it....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a silly, ah! Come, be quiet, be quiet! Be quiet, I will light the\\r\\nlantern,... silly!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman fumbled for the matches and lighted the lantern. But the\\r\\nlight did not comfort Alyoshka.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grandfather Stepan, let’s go to the village!” he besought him, weeping.\\r\\n“I am frightened here; oh, oh, how frightened I am! And why did you\\r\\nbring me from the village, accursed man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s an accursed man? You mustn’t use such disrespectable words to\\r\\nyour lawful grandfather. I shall whip you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do whip me, grandfather, do; beat me like Sidor’s goat, but only take\\r\\nme to mammy, for God’s mercy!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, grandson, come!” the coachman said kindly. “It’s all\\r\\nright, don’t be frightened....I am frightened myself.... Say your\\r\\nprayers!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door creaked and the porter’s head appeared. “Aren’t you asleep,\\r\\nStepan?” he asked. “I shan’t get any sleep all night,” he said, coming\\r\\nin. “I shall be opening and shutting the gates all night.... What are\\r\\nyou crying for, Alyoshka?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is frightened,” the coachman answered for his grandson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain there was the sound of a wailing voice in the air. The porter\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are crying. The mother can’t believe her eyes.... It’s dreadful\\r\\nhow upset she is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And is the father there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.... The father is all right. He sits in the corner and says\\r\\nnothing. They have taken the children to relations.... Well, Stepan,\\r\\nshall we have a game of trumps?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” the coachman agreed, scratching himself, “and you, Alyoshka, go\\r\\nto sleep. Almost big enough to be married, and blubbering, you rascal.\\r\\nCome, go along, grandson, go along....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of the porter reassured Alyoshka. He went, not very\\r\\nresolutely, towards the sledge and lay down. And while he was falling\\r\\nasleep he heard a half-whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beat and cover,” said his grandfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beat and cover,” repeated the porter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bell rang in the yard, the door creaked and seemed also saying: “I\\r\\nbeat and cover.” When Alyoshka dreamed of the gentleman and, frightened\\r\\nby his eyes, jumped up and burst out crying, it was morning, his\\r\\ngrandfather was snoring, and the coach-house no longer seemed terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPANIC FEARS\\r\\n\\r\\nDURING all the years I have been living in this world I have only three\\r\\ntimes been terrified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first real terror, which made my hair stand on end and made shivers\\r\\nrun all over me, was caused by a trivial but strange phenomenon. It\\r\\nhappened that, having nothing to do one July evening, I drove to the\\r\\nstation for the newspapers. It was a still, warm, almost sultry evening,\\r\\nlike all those monotonous evenings in July which, when once they have\\r\\nset in, go on for a week, a fortnight, or sometimes longer, in\\r\\nregular unbroken succession, and are suddenly cut short by a violent\\r\\nthunderstorm and a lavish downpour of rain that refreshes everything for\\r\\na long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had set some time before, and an unbroken gray dusk lay all over\\r\\nthe land. The mawkishly sweet scents of the grass and flowers were heavy\\r\\nin the motionless, stagnant air.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was driving in a rough trolley. Behind my back the gardener’s son\\r\\nPashka, a boy of eight years old, whom I had taken with me to look after\\r\\nthe horse in case of necessity, was gently snoring, with his head on a\\r\\nsack of oats. Our way lay along a narrow by-road, straight as a ruler,\\r\\nwhich lay hid like a great snake in the tall thick rye. There was a\\r\\npale light from the afterglow of sunset; a streak of light cut its way\\r\\nthrough a narrow, uncouth-looking cloud, which seemed sometimes like a\\r\\nboat and sometimes like a man wrapped in a quilt....\\r\\n\\r\\nI had driven a mile and a half, or two miles, when against the pale\\r\\nbackground of the evening glow there came into sight one after another\\r\\nsome graceful tall poplars; a river glimmered beyond them, and a\\r\\ngorgeous picture suddenly, as though by magic, lay stretched before me.\\r\\nI had to stop the horse, for our straight road broke off abruptly and\\r\\nran down a steep incline overgrown with bushes. We were standing on the\\r\\nhillside and beneath us at the bottom lay a huge hole full of twilight,\\r\\nof fantastic shapes, and of space. At the bottom of this hole, in a wide\\r\\nplain guarded by the poplars and caressed by the gleaming river, nestled\\r\\na village. It was now sleeping.... Its huts, its church with\\r\\nthe belfry, its trees, stood out against the gray twilight and were\\r\\nreflected darkly in the smooth surface of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waked Pashka for fear he should fall out and began cautiously going\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have we got to Lukovo?” asked Pashka, lifting his head lazily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Hold the reins!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nI led the horse down the hill and looked at the village. At the first\\r\\nglance one strange circumstance caught my attention: at the very top of\\r\\nthe belfry, in the tiny window between the cupola and the bells, a light\\r\\nwas twinkling. This light was like that of a smoldering lamp, at one\\r\\nmoment dying down, at another flickering up. What could it come from?\\r\\n\\r\\nIts source was beyond my comprehension. It could not be burning at the\\r\\nwindow, for there were neither ikons nor lamps in the top turret of\\r\\nthe belfry; there was nothing there, as I knew, but beams, dust, and\\r\\nspiders’ webs. It was hard to climb up into that turret, for the passage\\r\\nto it from the belfry was closely blocked up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was more likely than anything else to be the reflection of some\\r\\noutside light, but though I strained my eyes to the utmost, I could not\\r\\nsee one other speck of light in the vast expanse that lay before\\r\\nme. There was no moon. The pale and, by now, quite dim streak of the\\r\\nafterglow could not have been reflected, for the window looked not to\\r\\nthe west, but to the east. These and other similar considerations were\\r\\nstraying through my mind all the while that I was going down the slope\\r\\nwith the horse. At the bottom I sat down by the roadside and looked\\r\\nagain at the light. As before it was glimmering and flaring up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Strange,” I thought, lost in conjecture. “Very strange.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd little by little I was overcome by an unpleasant feeling. At first\\r\\nI thought that this was vexation at not being able to explain a simple\\r\\nphenomenon; but afterwards, when I suddenly turned away from the light\\r\\nin horror and caught hold of Pashka with one hand, it became clear that\\r\\nI was overcome with terror....\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with a feeling of loneliness, misery, and horror, as though\\r\\nI had been flung down against my will into this great hole full of\\r\\nshadows, where I was standing all alone with the belfry looking at me\\r\\nwith its red eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pashka!” I cried, closing my eyes in horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pashka, what’s that gleaming on the belfry?”\\r\\n\\r\\nPashka looked over my shoulder at the belfry and gave a yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who can tell?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brief conversation with the boy reassured me for a little, but not\\r\\nfor long. Pashka, seeing my uneasiness, fastened his big eyes upon the\\r\\nlight, looked at me again, then again at the light....\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am frightened,” he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, beside myself with terror, I clutched the boy with one\\r\\nhand, huddled up to him, and gave the horse a violent lash.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s stupid!” I said to myself. “That phenomenon is only terrible\\r\\nbecause I don’t understand it; everything we don’t understand is\\r\\nmysterious.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to persuade myself, but at the same time I did not leave off\\r\\nlashing the horse. When we reached the posting station I purposely\\r\\nstayed for a full hour chatting with the overseer, and read through two\\r\\nor three newspapers, but the feeling of uneasiness did not leave me.\\r\\nOn the way back the light was not to be seen, but on the other hand the\\r\\nsilhouettes of the huts, of the poplars, and of the hill up which I had\\r\\nto drive, seemed to me as though animated. And why the light was there I\\r\\ndon’t know to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second terror I experienced was excited by a circumstance no less\\r\\ntrivial.... I was returning from a romantic interview. It was one\\r\\no’clock at night, the time when nature is buried in the soundest,\\r\\nsweetest sleep before the dawn. That time nature was not sleeping,\\r\\nand one could not call the night a still one. Corncrakes, quails,\\r\\nnightingales, and woodcocks were calling, crickets and grasshoppers\\r\\nwere chirruping. There was a light mist over the grass, and clouds were\\r\\nscurrying straight ahead across the sky near the moon. Nature was awake,\\r\\nas though afraid of missing the best moments of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked along a narrow path at the very edge of a railway embankment.\\r\\nThe moonlight glided over the lines which were already covered with dew.\\r\\nGreat shadows from the clouds kept flitting over the embankment. Far\\r\\nahead, a dim green light was glimmering peacefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So everything is well,” I thought, looking at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a quiet, peaceful, comfortable feeling in my heart. I was\\r\\nreturning from a tryst, I had no need to hurry; I was not sleepy, and\\r\\nI was conscious of youth and health in every sigh, every step I took,\\r\\nrousing a dull echo in the monotonous hum of the night. I don’t know\\r\\nwhat I was feeling then, but I remember I was happy, very happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had gone not more than three-quarters of a mile when I suddenly heard\\r\\nbehind me a monotonous sound, a rumbling, rather like the roar of a\\r\\ngreat stream. It grew louder and louder every second, and sounded nearer\\r\\nand nearer. I looked round; a hundred paces from me was the dark copse\\r\\nfrom which I had only just come; there the embankment turned to the\\r\\nright in a graceful curve and vanished among the trees. I stood still in\\r\\nperplexity and waited. A huge black body appeared at once at the turn,\\r\\nnoisily darted towards me, and with the swiftness of a bird flew past\\r\\nme along the rails. Less than half a minute passed and the blur had\\r\\nvanished, the rumble melted away into the noise of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an ordinary goods truck. There was nothing peculiar about it in\\r\\nitself, but its appearance without an engine and in the night puzzled\\r\\nme. Where could it have come from and what force sent it flying so\\r\\nrapidly along the rails? Where did it come from and where was it flying\\r\\nto?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had been superstitious I should have made up my mind it was a party\\r\\nof demons and witches journeying to a devils’ sabbath, and should\\r\\nhave gone on my way; but as it was, the phenomenon was absolutely\\r\\ninexplicable to me. I did not believe my eyes, and was entangled in\\r\\nconjectures like a fly in a spider’s web....\\r\\n\\r\\nI suddenly realized that I was utterly alone on the whole vast plain;\\r\\nthat the night, which by now seemed inhospitable, was peeping into my\\r\\nface and dogging my footsteps; all the sounds, the cries of the birds,\\r\\nthe whisperings of the trees, seemed sinister, and existing simply to\\r\\nalarm my imagination. I dashed on like a madman, and without realizing\\r\\nwhat I was doing I ran, trying to run faster and faster. And at once I\\r\\nheard something to which I had paid no attention before: that is, the\\r\\nplaintive whining of the telegraph wires.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is beyond everything,” I said, trying to shame myself. “It’s\\r\\ncowardice! it’s silly!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut cowardice was stronger than common sense. I only slackened my pace\\r\\nwhen I reached the green light, where I saw a dark signal-box, and near\\r\\nit on the embankment the figure of a man, probably the signalman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see it?” I asked breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See whom? What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, a truck ran by.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw it,...” the peasant said reluctantly. “It broke away from the\\r\\ngoods train. There is an incline at the ninetieth mile...; the train\\r\\nis dragged uphill. The coupling on the last truck gave way, so it broke\\r\\noff and ran back.... There is no catching it now!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strange phenomenon was explained and its fantastic character\\r\\nvanished. My panic was over and I was able to go on my way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy third fright came upon me as I was going home from stand shooting in\\r\\nearly spring. It was in the dusk of evening. The forest road was covered\\r\\nwith pools from a recent shower of rain, and the earth squelched\\r\\nunder one’s feet. The crimson glow of sunset flooded the whole forest,\\r\\ncoloring the white stems of the birches and the young leaves. I was\\r\\nexhausted and could hardly move.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour or five miles from home, walking along the forest road, I suddenly\\r\\nmet a big black dog of the water spaniel breed. As he ran by, the dog\\r\\nlooked intently at me, straight in my face, and ran on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A nice dog!” I thought. “Whose is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked round. The dog was standing ten paces off with his eyes fixed\\r\\non me. For a minute we scanned each other in silence, then the dog,\\r\\nprobably flattered by my attention, came slowly up to me and wagged his\\r\\ntail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked on, the dog following me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whose dog can it be?” I kept asking myself. “Where does he come from?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew all the country gentry for twenty or thirty miles round, and knew\\r\\nall their dogs. Not one of them had a spaniel like that. How did he\\r\\ncome to be in the depths of the forest, on a track used for nothing\\r\\nbut carting timber? He could hardly have dropped behind someone passing\\r\\nthrough, for there was nowhere for the gentry to drive to along that\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on a stump to rest, and began scrutinizing my companion. He,\\r\\ntoo, sat down, raised his head, and fastened upon me an intent stare. He\\r\\ngazed at me without blinking. I don’t know whether it was the influence\\r\\nof the stillness, the shadows and sounds of the forest, or perhaps a\\r\\nresult of exhaustion, but I suddenly felt uneasy under the steady gaze\\r\\nof his ordinary doggy eyes. I thought of Faust and his bulldog, and\\r\\nof the fact that nervous people sometimes when exhausted have\\r\\nhallucinations. That was enough to make me get up hurriedly and\\r\\nhurriedly walk on. The dog followed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away!” I shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog probably liked my voice, for he gave a gleeful jump and ran\\r\\nabout in front of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go away!” I shouted again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog looked round, stared at me intently, and wagged his tail\\r\\ngood-humoredly. Evidently my threatening tone amused him. I ought to\\r\\nhave patted him, but I could not get Faust’s dog out of my head, and the\\r\\nfeeling of panic grew more and more acute... Darkness was coming on,\\r\\nwhich completed my confusion, and every time the dog ran up to me and\\r\\nhit me with his tail, like a coward I shut my eyes. The same thing\\r\\nhappened as with the light in the belfry and the truck on the railway: I\\r\\ncould not stand it and rushed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home I found a visitor, an old friend, who, after greeting me, began\\r\\nto complain that as he was driving to me he had lost his way in the\\r\\nforest, and a splendid valuable dog of his had dropped behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BET\\r\\n\\r\\nIT WAS a dark autumn night. The old banker was walking up and down his\\r\\nstudy and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party\\r\\none autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had\\r\\nbeen interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of\\r\\ncapital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many\\r\\njournalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They\\r\\nconsidered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable\\r\\nfor Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty\\r\\nought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t agree with you,” said their host the banker. “I have not tried\\r\\neither the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may\\r\\njudge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than\\r\\nimprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but\\r\\nlifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more\\r\\nhumane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out\\r\\nof you in the course of many years?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Both are equally immoral,” observed one of the guests, “for they both\\r\\nhave the same object--to take away life. The State is not God. It has\\r\\nnot the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty.\\r\\nWhen he was asked his opinion, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if\\r\\nI had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I\\r\\nwould certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous\\r\\nin those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the\\r\\ntable with his fist and shouted at the young man:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not true! I’ll bet you two millions you wouldn’t stay in solitary\\r\\nconfinement for five years.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you mean that in earnest,” said the young man, “I’ll take the bet,\\r\\nbut I would stay not five but fifteen years.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fifteen? Done!” cried the banker. “Gentlemen, I stake two millions!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!” said the young\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and\\r\\nfrivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet.\\r\\nAt supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two\\r\\nmillions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best\\r\\nyears of your life. I say three or four, because you won’t stay longer.\\r\\nDon’t forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a\\r\\ngreat deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have\\r\\nthe right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole\\r\\nexistence in prison. I am sorry for you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked\\r\\nhimself: “What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that\\r\\nman’s losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two\\r\\nmillions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than\\r\\nimprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless.\\r\\nOn my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple\\r\\ngreed for money....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the\\r\\nyoung man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest\\r\\nsupervision in one of the lodges in the banker’s garden. It was agreed\\r\\nthat for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of\\r\\nthe lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive\\r\\nletters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and\\r\\nbooks, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke.\\r\\nBy the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the\\r\\nouter world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He\\r\\nmight have anything he wanted--books, music, wine, and so on--in any\\r\\nquantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them\\r\\nthrough the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every\\r\\ntrifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the\\r\\nyoung man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve\\r\\no’clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o’clock of November\\r\\n14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if\\r\\nonly two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation\\r\\nto pay him two millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from\\r\\nhis brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and\\r\\ndepression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day\\r\\nand night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote,\\r\\nexcites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and\\r\\nbesides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing\\r\\nno one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the\\r\\nbooks he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a\\r\\ncomplicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner\\r\\nasked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again,\\r\\nand the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the\\r\\nwindow said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and\\r\\ndrinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to\\r\\nhimself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to\\r\\nwrite; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that\\r\\nhe had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously\\r\\nstudying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly\\r\\ninto these studies--so much so that the banker had enough to do to get\\r\\nhim the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred\\r\\nvolumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the\\r\\nbanker received the following letter from his prisoner:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to\\r\\npeople who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one\\r\\nmistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show\\r\\nme that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages\\r\\nand of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in\\r\\nthem all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels\\r\\nnow from being able to understand them!” The prisoner’s desire was\\r\\nfulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and\\r\\nread nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man\\r\\nwho in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste\\r\\nnearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and\\r\\nhistories of religion followed the Gospels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense\\r\\nquantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with\\r\\nthe natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There\\r\\nwere notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and\\r\\na manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or\\r\\ntheology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the\\r\\nwreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching\\r\\nfirst at one spar and then at another.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock he will regain his freedom. By our\\r\\nagreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all\\r\\nover with me: I shall be utterly ruined.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he\\r\\nwas afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets.\\r\\nDesperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the\\r\\nexcitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had\\r\\nby degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless,\\r\\nself-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank,\\r\\ntrembling at every rise and fall in his investments. “Cursed bet!”\\r\\n muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair. “Why didn’t the man\\r\\ndie? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will\\r\\nmarry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look\\r\\nat him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same\\r\\nsentence: ‘I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let\\r\\nme help you!’ No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from\\r\\nbankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck three o’clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the\\r\\nhouse and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled\\r\\ntrees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key\\r\\nof the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his\\r\\novercoat, and went out of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting\\r\\nwind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest.\\r\\nThe banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the\\r\\nwhite statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the\\r\\nlodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently\\r\\nthe watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep\\r\\nsomewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,” thought the old man,\\r\\n“Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the\\r\\nentry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and\\r\\nlighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with\\r\\nno bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove.\\r\\nThe seals on the door leading to the prisoner’s rooms were intact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped\\r\\nthrough the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner’s\\r\\nroom. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back,\\r\\nthe hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table,\\r\\non the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years’\\r\\nimprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the\\r\\nwindow with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in\\r\\nresponse. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and\\r\\nput the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the\\r\\ndoor creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry\\r\\nof astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in\\r\\nthe room. He made up his mind to go in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He\\r\\nwas a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls\\r\\nlike a woman’s and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy\\r\\ntint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the\\r\\nhand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate\\r\\nthat it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with\\r\\nsilver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have\\r\\nbelieved that he was only forty. He was asleep.... In front of his\\r\\nbowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was\\r\\nsomething written in fine handwriting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor creature!” thought the banker, “he is asleep and most likely\\r\\ndreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man,\\r\\nthrow him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most\\r\\nconscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us\\r\\nfirst read what he has written here....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow at twelve o’clock I regain my freedom and the right to\\r\\nassociate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the\\r\\nsunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear\\r\\nconscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise\\r\\nfreedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the\\r\\ngood things of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is\\r\\ntrue I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk\\r\\nfragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars\\r\\nin the forests, have loved women.... Beauties as ethereal as clouds,\\r\\ncreated by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at\\r\\nnight, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my\\r\\nbrain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz\\r\\nand Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched\\r\\nit at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold\\r\\nand crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my\\r\\nhead and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields,\\r\\nrivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the\\r\\nstrains of the shepherds’ pipes; I have touched the wings of comely\\r\\ndevils who flew down to converse with me of God.... In your books I\\r\\nhave flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain,\\r\\nburned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man\\r\\nhas created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain.\\r\\nI know that I am wiser than all of you.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this\\r\\nworld. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a\\r\\nmirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off\\r\\nthe face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing\\r\\nunder the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal\\r\\ngeniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies\\r\\nfor truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to\\r\\nstrange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple\\r\\nand orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a\\r\\nsweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I\\r\\ndon’t want to understand you.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I\\r\\nrenounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and\\r\\nwhich now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall\\r\\ngo out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the\\r\\ncompact....”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the\\r\\nstrange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other\\r\\ntime, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt\\r\\nso great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but\\r\\nhis tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had\\r\\nseen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the\\r\\ngarden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the\\r\\nservants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To\\r\\navoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in\\r\\nwhich the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in\\r\\nthe fireproof safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HEAD-GARDENER’S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nA SALE of flowers was taking place in Count N.’s greenhouses. The\\r\\npurchasers were few in number--a landowner who was a neighbor of mine,\\r\\na young timber-merchant, and myself. While the workmen were carrying out\\r\\nour magnificent purchases and packing them into the carts, we sat at the\\r\\nentry of the greenhouse and chatted about one thing and another. It\\r\\nis extremely pleasant to sit in a garden on a still April morning,\\r\\nlistening to the birds, and watching the flowers brought out into the\\r\\nopen air and basking in the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head-gardener, Mihail Karlovitch, a venerable old man with a full\\r\\nshaven face, wearing a fur waistcoat and no coat, superintended the\\r\\npacking of the plants himself, but at the same time he listened to\\r\\nour conversation in the hope of hearing something new. He was an\\r\\nintelligent, very good-hearted man, respected by everyone. He was\\r\\nfor some reason looked upon by everyone as a German, though he was in\\r\\nreality on his father’s side Swedish, on his mother’s side Russian, and\\r\\nattended the Orthodox church. He knew Russian, Swedish, and German. He\\r\\nhad read a good deal in those languages, and nothing one could do gave\\r\\nhim greater pleasure than lending him some new book or talking to him,\\r\\nfor instance, about Ibsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his weaknesses, but they were innocent ones: he called himself\\r\\nthe head gardener, though there were no under-gardeners; the expression\\r\\nof his face was unusually dignified and haughty; he could not endure to\\r\\nbe contradicted, and liked to be listened to with respect and attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That young fellow there I can recommend to you as an awful rascal,”\\r\\n said my neighbor, pointing to a laborer with a swarthy, gipsy face, who\\r\\ndrove by with the water-barrel. “Last week he was tried in the town for\\r\\nburglary and was acquitted; they pronounced him mentally deranged, and\\r\\nyet look at him, he is the picture of health. Scoundrels are very often\\r\\nacquitted nowadays in Russia on grounds of abnormality and aberration,\\r\\nyet these acquittals, these unmistakable proofs of an indulgent attitude\\r\\nto crime, lead to no good. They demoralize the masses, the sense of\\r\\njustice is blunted in all as they become accustomed to seeing vice\\r\\nunpunished, and you know in our age one may boldly say in the words of\\r\\nShakespeare that in our evil and corrupt age virtue must ask forgiveness\\r\\nof vice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s very true,” the merchant assented. “Owing to these frequent\\r\\nacquittals, murder and arson have become much more common. Ask the\\r\\npeasants.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMihail Karlovitch turned towards us and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“As far as I am concerned, gentlemen, I am always delighted to meet with\\r\\nthese verdicts of not guilty. I am not afraid for morality and justice\\r\\nwhen they say ‘Not guilty,’ but on the contrary I feel pleased. Even\\r\\nwhen my conscience tells me the jury have made a mistake in acquitting\\r\\nthe criminal, even then I am triumphant. Judge for yourselves,\\r\\ngentlemen; if the judges and the jury have more faith in _man_ than in\\r\\nevidence, material proofs, and speeches for the prosecution, is not that\\r\\nfaith _in man_ in itself higher than any ordinary considerations? Such\\r\\nfaith is only attainable by those few who understand and feel Christ.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine thought,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s not a new one. I remember a very long time ago I heard a\\r\\nlegend on that subject. A very charming legend,” said the gardener,\\r\\nand he smiled. “I was told it by my grandmother, my father’s mother, an\\r\\nexcellent old lady. She told me it in Swedish, and it does not sound so\\r\\nfine, so classical, in Russian.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we begged him to tell it and not to be put off by the coarseness of\\r\\nthe Russian language. Much gratified, he deliberately lighted his pipe,\\r\\nlooked angrily at the laborers, and began:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There settled in a certain little town a solitary, plain, elderly\\r\\ngentleman called Thomson or Wilson--but that does not matter; the\\r\\nsurname is not the point. He followed an honorable profession: he was\\r\\na doctor. He was always morose and unsociable, and only spoke when\\r\\nrequired by his profession. He never visited anyone, never extended his\\r\\nacquaintance beyond a silent bow, and lived as humbly as a hermit. The\\r\\nfact was, he was a learned man, and in those days learned men were not\\r\\nlike other people. They spent their days and nights in contemplation, in\\r\\nreading and in healing disease, looked upon everything else as trivial,\\r\\nand had no time to waste a word. The inhabitants of the town understood\\r\\nthis, and tried not to worry him with their visits and empty chatter.\\r\\nThey were very glad that God had sent them at last a man who could heal\\r\\ndiseases, and were proud that such a remarkable man was living in their\\r\\ntown. ‘He knows everything,’ they said about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that was not enough. They ought to have also said, ‘He loves\\r\\neveryone.’ In the breast of that learned man there beat a wonderful\\r\\nangelic heart. Though the people of that town were strangers and not his\\r\\nown people, yet he loved them like children, and did not spare himself\\r\\nfor them. He was himself ill with consumption, he had a cough, but when\\r\\nhe was summoned to the sick he forgot his own illness he did not spare\\r\\nhimself and, gasping for breath, climbed up the hills however high they\\r\\nmight be. He disregarded the sultry heat and the cold, despised thirst\\r\\nand hunger. He would accept no money and strange to say, when one of his\\r\\npatients died, he would follow the coffin with the relations, weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And soon he became so necessary to the town that the inhabitants\\r\\nwondered how they could have got on before without the man. Their\\r\\ngratitude knew no bounds. Grown-up people and children, good and bad\\r\\nalike, honest men and cheats--all in fact, respected him and knew his\\r\\nvalue. In the little town and all the surrounding neighborhood there\\r\\nwas no man who would allow himself to do anything disagreeable to him;\\r\\nindeed, they would never have dreamed of it. When he came out of his\\r\\nlodging, he never fastened the doors or windows, in complete confidence\\r\\nthat there was no thief who could bring himself to do him wrong.\\r\\nHe often had in the course of his medical duties to walk along the\\r\\nhighroads, through the forests and mountains haunted by numbers of\\r\\nhungry vagrants; but he felt that he was in perfect security.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One night he was returning from a patient when robbers fell upon him\\r\\nin the forest, but when they recognized him, they took off their hats\\r\\nrespectfully and offered him something to eat. When he answered that he\\r\\nwas not hungry, they gave him a warm wrap and accompanied him as far as\\r\\nthe town, happy that fate had given them the chance in some small way\\r\\nto show their gratitude to the benevolent man. Well, to be sure, my\\r\\ngrandmother told me that even the horses and the cows and the dogs knew\\r\\nhim and expressed their joy when they met him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And this man who seemed by his sanctity to have guarded himself from\\r\\nevery evil, to whom even brigands and frenzied men wished nothing but\\r\\ngood, was one fine morning found murdered. Covered with blood, with\\r\\nhis skull broken, he was lying in a ravine, and his pale face wore an\\r\\nexpression of amazement. Yes, not horror but amazement was the emotion\\r\\nthat had been fixed upon his face when he saw the murderer before him.\\r\\nYou can imagine the grief that overwhelmed the inhabitants of the town\\r\\nand the surrounding districts. All were in despair, unable to believe\\r\\ntheir eyes, wondering who could have killed the man. The judges who\\r\\nconducted the inquiry and examined the doctor’s body said: ‘Here we\\r\\nhave all the signs of a murder, but as there is not a man in the world\\r\\ncapable of murdering our doctor, obviously it was not a case of murder,\\r\\nand the combination of evidence is due to simple chance. We must suppose\\r\\nthat in the darkness he fell into the ravine of himself and was mortally\\r\\ninjured.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The whole town agreed with this opinion. The doctor was buried, and\\r\\nnothing more was said about a violent death. The existence of a man\\r\\nwho could have the baseness and wickedness to kill the doctor seemed\\r\\nincredible. There is a limit even to wickedness, isn’t there?\\r\\n\\r\\n“All at once, would you believe it, chance led them to discovering the\\r\\nmurderer. A vagrant who had been many times convicted, notorious for his\\r\\nvicious life, was seen selling for drink a snuff-box and watch that\\r\\nhad belonged to the doctor. When he was questioned he was confused,\\r\\nand answered with an obvious lie. A search was made, and in his bed was\\r\\nfound a shirt with stains of blood on the sleeves, and a doctor’s lancet\\r\\nset in gold. What more evidence was wanted? They put the criminal in\\r\\nprison. The inhabitants were indignant, and at the same time said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It’s incredible! It can’t be so! Take care that a mistake is not\\r\\nmade; it does happen, you know, that evidence tells a false tale.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“At his trial the murderer obstinately denied his guilt. Everything was\\r\\nagainst him, and to be convinced of his guilt was as easy as to believe\\r\\nthat this earth is black; but the judges seem to have gone mad: they\\r\\nweighed every proof ten times, looked distrustfully at the witnesses,\\r\\nflushed crimson and sipped water.... The trial began early in the\\r\\nmorning and was only finished in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Accused!’ the chief judge said, addressing the murderer, ‘the court\\r\\nhas found you guilty of murdering Dr. So-and-so, and has sentenced you\\r\\nto....’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The chief judge meant to say ‘to the death penalty,’ but he dropped\\r\\nfrom his hands the paper on which the sentence was written, wiped the\\r\\ncold sweat from his face, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No! May God punish me if I judge wrongly, but I swear he is not\\r\\nguilty. I cannot admit the thought that there exists a man who would\\r\\ndare to murder our friend the doctor! A man could not sink so low!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There cannot be such a man!’ the other judges assented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No,’ the crowd cried. ‘Let him go!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The murderer was set free to go where he chose, and not one soul blamed\\r\\nthe court for an unjust verdict. And my grandmother used to say that for\\r\\nsuch faith in humanity God forgave the sins of all the inhabitants of\\r\\nthat town. He rejoices when people believe that man is His image and\\r\\nsemblance, and grieves if, forgetful of human dignity, they judge worse\\r\\nof men than of dogs. The sentence of acquittal may bring harm to the\\r\\ninhabitants of the town, but on the other hand, think of the beneficial\\r\\ninfluence upon them of that faith in man--a faith which does not remain\\r\\ndead, you know; it raises up generous feelings in us, and always impels\\r\\nus to love and respect every man. Every man! And that is important.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMihail Karlovitch had finished. My neighbor would have urged some\\r\\nobjection, but the head-gardener made a gesture that signified that he\\r\\ndid not like objections; then he walked away to the carts, and, with an\\r\\nexpression of dignity, went on looking after the packing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BEAUTIES\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nI REMEMBER, when I was a high school boy in the fifth or sixth class, I\\r\\nwas driving with my grandfather from the village of Bolshoe Kryepkoe in\\r\\nthe Don region to Rostov-on-the-Don. It was a sultry, languidly dreary\\r\\nday of August. Our eyes were glued together, and our mouths were parched\\r\\nfrom the heat and the dry burning wind which drove clouds of dust to\\r\\nmeet us; one did not want to look or speak or think, and when our drowsy\\r\\ndriver, a Little Russian called Karpo, swung his whip at the horses\\r\\nand lashed me on my cap, I did not protest or utter a sound, but only,\\r\\nrousing myself from half-slumber, gazed mildly and dejectedly into the\\r\\ndistance to see whether there was a village visible through the dust.\\r\\nWe stopped to feed the horses in a big Armenian village at a rich\\r\\nArmenian’s whom my grandfather knew. Never in my life have I seen a\\r\\ngreater caricature than that Armenian. Imagine a little shaven head with\\r\\nthick overhanging eyebrows, a beak of a nose, long gray mustaches, and\\r\\na wide mouth with a long cherry-wood chibouk sticking out of it. This\\r\\nlittle head was clumsily attached to a lean hunch-back carcass attired\\r\\nin a fantastic garb, a short red jacket, and full bright blue trousers.\\r\\nThis figure walked straddling its legs and shuffling with its slippers,\\r\\nspoke without taking the chibouk out of its mouth, and behaved with\\r\\ntruly Armenian dignity, not smiling, but staring with wide-open eyes and\\r\\ntrying to take as little notice as possible of its guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was neither wind nor dust in the Armenian’s rooms, but it was just\\r\\nas unpleasant, stifling, and dreary as in the steppe and on the road.\\r\\nI remember, dusty and exhausted by the heat, I sat in the corner on a\\r\\ngreen box. The unpainted wooden walls, the furniture, and the floors\\r\\ncolored with yellow ocher smelt of dry wood baked by the sun. Wherever\\r\\nI looked there were flies and flies and flies.... Grandfather and the\\r\\nArmenian were talking about grazing, about manure, and about oats....\\r\\nI knew that they would be a good hour getting the samovar; that\\r\\ngrandfather would be not less than an hour drinking his tea, and then\\r\\nwould lie down to sleep for two or three hours; that I should waste a\\r\\nquarter of the day waiting, after which there would be again the heat,\\r\\nthe dust, the jolting cart. I heard the muttering of the two voices, and\\r\\nit began to seem to me that I had been seeing the Armenian, the cupboard\\r\\nwith the crockery, the flies, the windows with the burning sun beating\\r\\non them, for ages and ages, and should only cease to see them in the\\r\\nfar-off future, and I was seized with hatred for the steppe, the sun,\\r\\nthe flies....\\r\\n\\r\\nA Little Russian peasant woman in a kerchief brought in a tray of\\r\\ntea-things, then the samovar. The Armenian went slowly out into the\\r\\npassage and shouted: “Mashya, come and pour out tea! Where are you,\\r\\nMashya?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHurried footsteps were heard, and there came into the room a girl of\\r\\nsixteen in a simple cotton dress and a white kerchief. As she washed the\\r\\ncrockery and poured out the tea, she was standing with her back to me,\\r\\nand all I could see was that she was of a slender figure, barefooted,\\r\\nand that her little bare heels were covered by long trousers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Armenian invited me to have tea. Sitting down to the table, I\\r\\nglanced at the girl, who was handing me a glass of tea, and felt all at\\r\\nonce as though a wind were blowing over my soul and blowing away all\\r\\nthe impressions of the day with their dust and dreariness. I saw the\\r\\nbewitching features of the most beautiful face I have ever met in real\\r\\nlife or in my dreams. Before me stood a beauty, and I recognized that at\\r\\nthe first glance as I should have recognized lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am ready to swear that Masha--or, as her father called her,\\r\\nMashya--was a real beauty, but I don’t know how to prove it. It\\r\\nsometimes happens that clouds are huddled together in disorder on the\\r\\nhorizon, and the sun hiding behind them colors them and the sky with\\r\\ntints of every possible shade--crimson, orange, gold, lilac, muddy pink;\\r\\none cloud is like a monk, another like a fish, a third like a Turk in a\\r\\nturban. The glow of sunset enveloping a third of the sky gleams on\\r\\nthe cross on the church, flashes on the windows of the manor house, is\\r\\nreflected in the river and the puddles, quivers on the trees; far, far\\r\\naway against the background of the sunset, a flock of wild ducks is\\r\\nflying homewards.... And the boy herding the cows, and the surveyor\\r\\ndriving in his chaise over the dam, and the gentleman out for a walk,\\r\\nall gaze at the sunset, and every one of them thinks it terribly\\r\\nbeautiful, but no one knows or can say in what its beauty lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not the only one to think the Armenian girl beautiful. My\\r\\ngrandfather, an old man of seventy, gruff and indifferent to women and\\r\\nthe beauties of nature, looked caressingly at Masha for a full minute,\\r\\nand asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that your daughter, Avert Nazaritch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she is my daughter,” answered the Armenian.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine young lady,” said my grandfather approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn artist would have called the Armenian girl’s beauty classical and\\r\\nsevere, it was just that beauty, the contemplation of which--God\\r\\nknows why!--inspires in one the conviction that one is seeing correct\\r\\nfeatures; that hair, eyes, nose, mouth, neck, bosom, and every movement\\r\\nof the young body all go together in one complete harmonious accord in\\r\\nwhich nature has not blundered over the smallest line. You fancy for\\r\\nsome reason that the ideally beautiful woman must have such a nose as\\r\\nMasha’s, straight and slightly aquiline, just such great dark eyes, such\\r\\nlong lashes, such a languid glance; you fancy that her black curly hair\\r\\nand eyebrows go with the soft white tint of her brow and cheeks as\\r\\nthe green reeds go with the quiet stream. Masha’s white neck and her\\r\\nyouthful bosom were not fully developed, but you fancy the sculptor\\r\\nwould need a great creative genius to mold them. You gaze, and little\\r\\nby little the desire comes over you to say to Masha something\\r\\nextraordinarily pleasant, sincere, beautiful, as beautiful as she\\r\\nherself was.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I felt hurt and abashed that Masha took no notice of me, but\\r\\nwas all the time looking down; it seemed to me as though a peculiar\\r\\natmosphere, proud and happy, separated her from me and jealously\\r\\nscreened her from my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s because I am covered with dust,” I thought, “am sunburnt, and am\\r\\nstill a boy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little by little I forgot myself, and gave myself up entirely to the\\r\\nconsciousness of beauty. I thought no more now of the dreary steppe, of\\r\\nthe dust, no longer heard the buzzing of the flies, no longer tasted the\\r\\ntea, and felt nothing except that a beautiful girl was standing only the\\r\\nother side of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt this beauty rather strangely. It was not desire, nor ecstacy,\\r\\nnor enjoyment that Masha excited in me, but a painful though pleasant\\r\\nsadness. It was a sadness vague and undefined as a dream. For some\\r\\nreason I felt sorry for myself, for my grandfather and for the Armenian,\\r\\neven for the girl herself, and I had a feeling as though we all four\\r\\nhad lost something important and essential to life which we should never\\r\\nfind again. My grandfather, too, grew melancholy; he talked no more\\r\\nabout manure or about oats, but sat silent, looking pensively at Masha.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter tea my grandfather lay down for a nap while I went out of the\\r\\nhouse into the porch. The house, like all the houses in the Armenian\\r\\nvillage stood in the full sun; there was not a tree, not an awning, no\\r\\nshade. The Armenian’s great courtyard, overgrown with goosefoot and\\r\\nwild mallows, was lively and full of gaiety in spite of the great heat.\\r\\nThreshing was going on behind one of the low hurdles which intersected\\r\\nthe big yard here and there. Round a post stuck into the middle of the\\r\\nthreshing-floor ran a dozen horses harnessed side by side, so that they\\r\\nformed one long radius. A Little Russian in a long waistcoat and full\\r\\ntrousers was walking beside them, cracking a whip and shouting in a tone\\r\\nthat sounded as though he were jeering at the horses and showing off his\\r\\npower over them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A--a--a, you damned brutes!... A--a--a, plague take you! Are you\\r\\nfrightened?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses, sorrel, white, and piebald, not understanding why they\\r\\nwere made to run round in one place and to crush the wheat straw, ran\\r\\nunwillingly as though with effort, swinging their tails with an offended\\r\\nair. The wind raised up perfect clouds of golden chaff from under their\\r\\nhoofs and carried it away far beyond the hurdle. Near the tall fresh\\r\\nstacks peasant women were swarming with rakes, and carts were moving,\\r\\nand beyond the stacks in another yard another dozen similar horses were\\r\\nrunning round a post, and a similar Little Russian was cracking his whip\\r\\nand jeering at the horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steps on which I was sitting were hot; on the thin rails and here\\r\\nand there on the window-frames sap was oozing out of the wood from the\\r\\nheat; red ladybirds were huddling together in the streaks of shadow\\r\\nunder the steps and under the shutters. The sun was baking me on my\\r\\nhead, on my chest, and on my back, but I did not notice it, and was\\r\\nconscious only of the thud of bare feet on the uneven floor in the\\r\\npassage and in the rooms behind me. After clearing away the tea-things,\\r\\nMasha ran down the steps, fluttering the air as she passed, and like\\r\\na bird flew into a little grimy outhouse--I suppose the kitchen--from\\r\\nwhich came the smell of roast mutton and the sound of angry talk in\\r\\nArmenian. She vanished into the dark doorway, and in her place there\\r\\nappeared on the threshold an old bent, red-faced Armenian woman wearing\\r\\ngreen trousers. The old woman was angry and was scolding someone. Soon\\r\\nafterwards Masha appeared in the doorway, flushed with the heat of\\r\\nthe kitchen and carrying a big black loaf on her shoulder; swaying\\r\\ngracefully under the weight of the bread, she ran across the yard to the\\r\\nthreshing-floor, darted over the hurdle, and, wrapt in a cloud of golden\\r\\nchaff, vanished behind the carts. The Little Russian who was driving the\\r\\nhorses lowered his whip, sank into silence, and gazed for a minute in\\r\\nthe direction of the carts. Then when the Armenian girl darted again by\\r\\nthe horses and leaped over the hurdle, he followed her with his\\r\\neyes, and shouted to the horses in a tone as though he were greatly\\r\\ndisappointed:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Plague take you, unclean devils!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the while I was unceasingly hearing her bare feet, and seeing\\r\\nhow she walked across the yard with a grave, preoccupied face. She ran\\r\\nnow down the steps, swishing the air about me, now into the kitchen, now\\r\\nto the threshing-floor, now through the gate, and I could hardly turn my\\r\\nhead quickly enough to watch her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the oftener she fluttered by me with her beauty, the more acute\\r\\nbecame my sadness. I felt sorry both for her and for myself and for the\\r\\nLittle Russian, who mournfully watched her every time she ran through\\r\\nthe cloud of chaff to the carts. Whether it was envy of her beauty, or\\r\\nthat I was regretting that the girl was not mine, and never would be,\\r\\nor that I was a stranger to her; or whether I vaguely felt that her rare\\r\\nbeauty was accidental, unnecessary, and, like everything on earth,\\r\\nof short duration; or whether, perhaps, my sadness was that peculiar\\r\\nfeeling which is excited in man by the contemplation of real beauty, God\\r\\nonly knows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three hours of waiting passed unnoticed. It seemed to me that I had\\r\\nnot had time to look properly at Masha when Karpo drove up to the river,\\r\\nbathed the horse, and began to put it in the shafts. The wet horse\\r\\nsnorted with pleasure and kicked his hoofs against the shafts. Karpo\\r\\nshouted to it: “Ba--ack!” My grandfather woke up. Masha opened the\\r\\ncreaking gates for us, we got into the chaise and drove out of the yard.\\r\\nWe drove in silence as though we were angry with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, two or three hours later, Rostov and Nahitchevan appeared in\\r\\nthe distance, Karpo, who had been silent the whole time, looked round\\r\\nquickly, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine wench, that at the Armenian’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he lashed his horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother time, after I had become a student, I was traveling by rail to\\r\\nthe south. It was May. At one of the stations, I believe it was between\\r\\nByelgorod and Harkov, I got out of the tram to walk about the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shades of evening were already lying on the station garden, on the\\r\\nplatform, and on the fields; the station screened off the sunset, but on\\r\\nthe topmost clouds of smoke from the engine, which were tinged with rosy\\r\\nlight, one could see the sun had not yet quite vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked up and down the platform I noticed that the greater\\r\\nnumber of the passengers were standing or walking near a second-class\\r\\ncompartment, and that they looked as though some celebrated person were\\r\\nin that compartment. Among the curious whom I met near this compartment\\r\\nI saw, however, an artillery officer who had been my fellow-traveler, an\\r\\nintelligent, cordial, and sympathetic fellow--as people mostly are\\r\\nwhom we meet on our travels by chance and with whom we are not long\\r\\nacquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you looking at there?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, but only indicated with his eyes a feminine figure.\\r\\nIt was a young girl of seventeen or eighteen, wearing a Russian dress,\\r\\nwith her head bare and a little shawl flung carelessly on one\\r\\nshoulder; not a passenger, but I suppose a sister or daughter of the\\r\\nstation-master. She was standing near the carriage window, talking to an\\r\\nelderly woman who was in the train. Before I had time to realize what\\r\\nI was seeing, I was suddenly overwhelmed by the feeling I had once\\r\\nexperienced in the Armenian village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl was remarkably beautiful, and that was unmistakable to me and\\r\\nto those who were looking at her as I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one is to describe her appearance feature by feature, as the practice\\r\\nis, the only really lovely thing was her thick wavy fair hair, which\\r\\nhung loose with a black ribbon tied round her head; all the other\\r\\nfeatures were either irregular or very ordinary. Either from a peculiar\\r\\nform of coquettishness, or from short-sightedness, her eyes were screwed\\r\\nup, her nose had an undecided tilt, her mouth was small, her profile was\\r\\nfeebly and insipidly drawn, her shoulders were narrow and undeveloped\\r\\nfor her age--and yet the girl made the impression of being really\\r\\nbeautiful, and looking at her, I was able to feel convinced that the\\r\\nRussian face does not need strict regularity in order to be lovely; what\\r\\nis more, that if instead of her turn-up nose the girl had been given a\\r\\ndifferent one, correct and plastically irreproachable like the Armenian\\r\\ngirl’s, I fancy her face would have lost all its charm from the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding at the window talking, the girl, shrugging at the evening damp,\\r\\ncontinually looking round at us, at one moment put her arms akimbo, at\\r\\nthe next raised her hands to her head to straighten her hair, talked,\\r\\nlaughed, while her face at one moment wore an expression of wonder, the\\r\\nnext of horror, and I don’t remember a moment when her face and body\\r\\nwere at rest. The whole secret and magic of her beauty lay just in these\\r\\ntiny, infinitely elegant movements, in her smile, in the play of her\\r\\nface, in her rapid glances at us, in the combination of the subtle grace\\r\\nof her movements with her youth, her freshness, the purity of her soul\\r\\nthat sounded in her laugh and voice, and with the weakness we love so\\r\\nmuch in children, in birds, in fawns, and in young trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was that butterfly’s beauty so in keeping with waltzing, darting\\r\\nabout the garden, laughter and gaiety, and incongruous with serious\\r\\nthought, grief, and repose; and it seemed as though a gust of wind\\r\\nblowing over the platform, or a fall of rain, would be enough to wither\\r\\nthe fragile body and scatter the capricious beauty like the pollen of a\\r\\nflower.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So--o!...” the officer muttered with a sigh when, after the second\\r\\nbell, we went back to our compartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what that “So--o” meant I will not undertake to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps he was sad, and did not want to go away from the beauty and\\r\\nthe spring evening into the stuffy train; or perhaps he, like me, was\\r\\nunaccountably sorry for the beauty, for himself, and for me, and for all\\r\\nthe passengers, who were listlessly and reluctantly sauntering back to\\r\\ntheir compartments. As we passed the station window, at which a pale,\\r\\nred-haired telegraphist with upstanding curls and a faded, broad-cheeked\\r\\nface was sitting beside his apparatus, the officer heaved a sigh and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I bet that telegraphist is in love with that pretty girl. To live out\\r\\nin the wilds under one roof with that ethereal creature and not fall in\\r\\nlove is beyond the power of man. And what a calamity, my friend! what an\\r\\nironical fate, to be stooping, unkempt, gray, a decent fellow and not a\\r\\nfool, and to be in love with that pretty, stupid little girl who would\\r\\nnever take a scrap of notice of you! Or worse still: imagine that\\r\\ntelegraphist is in love, and at the same time married, and that his wife\\r\\nis as stooping, as unkempt, and as decent a person as himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the platform between our carriage and the next the guard was\\r\\nstanding with his elbows on the railing, looking in the direction of\\r\\nthe beautiful girl, and his battered, wrinkled, unpleasantly beefy face,\\r\\nexhausted by sleepless nights and the jolting of the train, wore a look\\r\\nof tenderness and of the deepest sadness, as though in that girl he saw\\r\\nhappiness, his own youth, soberness, purity, wife, children; as though\\r\\nhe were repenting and feeling in his whole being that that girl was not\\r\\nhis, and that for him, with his premature old age, his uncouthness, and\\r\\nhis beefy face, the ordinary happiness of a man and a passenger was as\\r\\nfar away as heaven....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third bell rang, the whistles sounded, and the train slowly moved\\r\\noff. First the guard, the station-master, then the garden, the beautiful\\r\\ngirl with her exquisitely sly smile, passed before our windows....\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting my head out and looking back, I saw how, looking after the\\r\\ntrain, she walked along the platform by the window where the telegraph\\r\\nclerk was sitting, smoothed her hair, and ran into the garden. The\\r\\nstation no longer screened off the sunset, the plain lay open before us,\\r\\nbut the sun had already set and the smoke lay in black clouds over the\\r\\ngreen, velvety young corn. It was melancholy in the spring air, and in\\r\\nthe darkening sky, and in the railway carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe familiar figure of the guard came into the carriage, and he began\\r\\nlighting the candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHOEMAKER AND THE DEVIL\\r\\n\\r\\nIT was Christmas Eve. Marya had long been snoring on the stove; all the\\r\\nparaffin in the little lamp had burnt out, but Fyodor Nilov still sat at\\r\\nwork. He would long ago have flung aside his work and gone out into the\\r\\nstreet, but a customer from Kolokolny Lane, who had a fortnight before\\r\\nordered some boots, had been in the previous day, had abused him\\r\\nroundly, and had ordered him to finish the boots at once before the\\r\\nmorning service.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a convict’s life!” Fyodor grumbled as he worked. “Some people have\\r\\nbeen asleep long ago, others are enjoying themselves, while you sit here\\r\\nlike some Cain and sew for the devil knows whom....”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo save himself from accidentally falling asleep, he kept taking a\\r\\nbottle from under the table and drinking out of it, and after every pull\\r\\nat it he twisted his head and said aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the reason, kindly tell me, that customers enjoy themselves\\r\\nwhile I am forced to sit and work for them? Because they have money and\\r\\nI am a beggar?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hated all his customers, especially the one who lived in Kolokolny\\r\\nLane. He was a gentleman of gloomy appearance, with long hair, a yellow\\r\\nface, blue spectacles, and a husky voice. He had a German name which one\\r\\ncould not pronounce. It was impossible to tell what was his calling\\r\\nand what he did. When, a fortnight before, Fyodor had gone to take his\\r\\nmeasure, he, the customer, was sitting on the floor pounding something\\r\\nin a mortar. Before Fyodor had time to say good-morning the contents of\\r\\nthe mortar suddenly flared up and burned with a bright red flame; there\\r\\nwas a stink of sulphur and burnt feathers, and the room was filled\\r\\nwith a thick pink smoke, so that Fyodor sneezed five times; and as he\\r\\nreturned home afterwards, he thought: “Anyone who feared God would not\\r\\nhave anything to do with things like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen there was nothing left in the bottle Fyodor put the boots on the\\r\\ntable and sank into thought. He leaned his heavy head on his fist and\\r\\nbegan thinking of his poverty, of his hard life with no glimmer of\\r\\nlight in it. Then he thought of the rich, of their big houses and their\\r\\ncarriages, of their hundred-rouble notes.... How nice it would be\\r\\nif the houses of these rich men--the devil flay them!--were smashed,\\r\\nif their horses died, if their fur coats and sable caps got shabby! How\\r\\nsplendid it would be if the rich, little by little, changed into beggars\\r\\nhaving nothing, and he, a poor shoemaker, were to become rich, and were\\r\\nto lord it over some other poor shoemaker on Christmas Eve.\\r\\n\\r\\nDreaming like this, Fyodor suddenly thought of his work, and opened his\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s a go,” he thought, looking at the boots. “The job has been\\r\\nfinished ever so long ago, and I go on sitting here. I must take the\\r\\nboots to the gentleman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrapped up the work in a red handkerchief, put on his things, and\\r\\nwent out into the street. A fine hard snow was falling, pricking the\\r\\nface as though with needles. It was cold, slippery, dark, the gas-lamps\\r\\nburned dimly, and for some reason there was a smell of paraffin in the\\r\\nstreet, so that Fyodor coughed and cleared his throat. Rich men were\\r\\ndriving to and fro on the road, and every rich man had a ham and a\\r\\nbottle of vodka in his hands. Rich young ladies peeped at Fyodor out of\\r\\nthe carriages and sledges, put out their tongues and shouted, laughing:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beggar! Beggar!”\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents, officers, and merchants walked behind Fyodor, jeering at him\\r\\nand crying:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Drunkard! Drunkard! Infidel cobbler! Soul of a boot-leg! Beggar!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was insulting, but Fyodor held his tongue and only spat in\\r\\ndisgust. But when Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, a master-bootmaker, met\\r\\nhim and said: “I’ve married a rich woman and I have men working under\\r\\nme, while you are a beggar and have nothing to eat,” Fyodor could not\\r\\nrefrain from running after him. He pursued him till he found himself in\\r\\nKolokolny Lane. His customer lived in the fourth house from the corner\\r\\non the very top floor. To reach him one had to go through a long, dark\\r\\ncourtyard, and then to climb up a very high slippery stair-case which\\r\\ntottered under one’s feet. When Fyodor went in to him he was sitting\\r\\non the floor pounding something in a mortar, just as he had been the\\r\\nfortnight before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor, I have brought your boots,” said Fyodor sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe customer got up and began trying on the boots in silence. Desiring\\r\\nto help him, Fyodor went down on one knee and pulled off his old, boot,\\r\\nbut at once jumped up and staggered towards the door in horror. The\\r\\ncustomer had not a foot, but a hoof like a horse’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aha!” thought Fyodor; “here’s a go!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing should have been to cross himself, then to leave\\r\\neverything and run downstairs; but he immediately reflected that he was\\r\\nmeeting a devil for the first and probably the last time, and not to\\r\\ntake advantage of his services would be foolish. He controlled himself\\r\\nand determined to try his luck. Clasping his hands behind him to avoid\\r\\nmaking the sign of the cross, he coughed respectfully and began:\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say that there is nothing on earth more evil and impure than the\\r\\ndevil, but I am of the opinion, your honor, that the devil is highly\\r\\neducated. He has--excuse my saying it--hoofs and a tail behind, but he\\r\\nhas more brains than many a student.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I like you for what you say,” said the devil, flattered. “Thank you,\\r\\nshoemaker! What do you want?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd without loss of time the shoemaker began complaining of his lot. He\\r\\nbegan by saying that from his childhood up he had envied the rich. He\\r\\nhad always resented it that all people did not live alike in big houses\\r\\nand drive with good horses. Why, he asked, was he poor? How was he worse\\r\\nthan Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, who had his own house, and whose wife\\r\\nwore a hat? He had the same sort of nose, the same hands, feet, head,\\r\\nand back, as the rich, and so why was he forced to work when others\\r\\nwere enjoying themselves? Why was he married to Marya and not to a\\r\\nlady smelling of scent? He had often seen beautiful young ladies in\\r\\nthe houses of rich customers, but they either took no notice of him\\r\\nwhatever, or else sometimes laughed and whispered to each other: “What\\r\\na red nose that shoemaker has!” It was true that Marya was a good, kind,\\r\\nhard-working woman, but she was not educated; her hand was heavy and\\r\\nhit hard, and if one had occasion to speak of politics or anything\\r\\nintellectual before her, she would put her spoke in and talk the most\\r\\nawful nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want, then?” his customer interrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg you, your honor Satan Ivanitch, to be graciously pleased to make\\r\\nme a rich man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. Only for that you must give me up your soul! Before the\\r\\ncocks crow, go and sign on this paper here that you give me up your\\r\\nsoul.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor,” said Fyodor politely, “when you ordered a pair of boots\\r\\nfrom me I did not ask for the money in advance. One has first to carry\\r\\nout the order and then ask for payment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very well!” the customer assented.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bright flame suddenly flared up in the mortar, a pink thick smoke came\\r\\npuffing out, and there was a smell of burnt feathers and sulphur. When\\r\\nthe smoke had subsided, Fyodor rubbed his eyes and saw that he was no\\r\\nlonger Fyodor, no longer a shoemaker, but quite a different man, wearing\\r\\na waistcoat and a watch-chain, in a new pair of trousers, and that he\\r\\nwas sitting in an armchair at a big table. Two foot men were handing him\\r\\ndishes, bowing low and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kindly eat, your honor, and may it do you good!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wealth! The footmen handed him a big piece of roast mutton and a\\r\\ndish of cucumbers, and then brought in a frying-pan a roast goose, and\\r\\na little afterwards boiled pork with horse-radish cream. And how\\r\\ndignified, how genteel it all was! Fyodor ate, and before each dish\\r\\ndrank a big glass of excellent vodka, like some general or some count.\\r\\nAfter the pork he was handed some boiled grain moistened with goose fat,\\r\\nthen an omelette with bacon fat, then fried liver, and he went on eating\\r\\nand was delighted. What more? They served, too, a pie with onion and\\r\\nsteamed turnip with kvass.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is it the gentry don’t burst with such meals?” he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion they handed him a big pot of honey. After dinner the devil\\r\\nappeared in blue spectacles and asked with a low bow:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you satisfied with your dinner, Fyodor Pantelyeitch?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fyodor could not answer one word, he was so stuffed after his\\r\\ndinner. The feeling of repletion was unpleasant, oppressive, and to\\r\\ndistract his thoughts he looked at the boot on his left foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For a boot like that I used not to take less than seven and a half\\r\\nroubles. What shoemaker made it?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kuzma Lebyodkin,” answered the footman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Send for him, the fool!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw soon made his appearance. He stopped in a\\r\\nrespectful attitude at the door and asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are your orders, your honor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold your tongue!” cried Fyodor, and stamped his foot. “Don’t dare to\\r\\nargue; remember your place as a cobbler! Blockhead! You don’t know how\\r\\nto make boots! I’ll beat your ugly phiz to a jelly! Why have you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What money? Be off! Come on Saturday! Boy, give him a cuff!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he at once recalled what a life the customers used to lead him, too,\\r\\nand he felt heavy at heart, and to distract his attention he took a fat\\r\\npocketbook out of his pocket and began counting his money. There was a\\r\\ngreat deal of money, but Fyodor wanted more still. The devil in the blue\\r\\nspectacles brought him another notebook fatter still, but he wanted even\\r\\nmore; and the more he counted it, the more discontented he became.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening the evil one brought him a full-bosomed lady in a red\\r\\ndress, and said that this was his new wife. He spent the whole evening\\r\\nkissing her and eating gingerbreads, and at night he went to bed on a\\r\\nsoft, downy feather-bed, turned from side to side, and could not go to\\r\\nsleep. He felt uncanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a great deal of money,” he said to his wife; “we must look\\r\\nout or thieves will be breaking in. You had better go and look with a\\r\\ncandle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not sleep all night, and kept getting up to see if his box was\\r\\nall right. In the morning he had to go to church to matins. In church\\r\\nthe same honor is done to rich and poor alike. When Fyodor was poor he\\r\\nused to pray in church like this: “God, forgive me, a sinner!” He said\\r\\nthe same thing now though he had become rich. What difference was\\r\\nthere? And after death Fyodor rich would not be buried in gold, not\\r\\nin diamonds, but in the same black earth as the poorest beggar. Fyodor\\r\\nwould burn in the same fire as cobblers. Fyodor resented all this, and,\\r\\ntoo, he felt weighed down all over by his dinner, and instead of prayer\\r\\nhe had all sorts of thoughts in his head about his box of money, about\\r\\nthieves, about his bartered, ruined soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came out of church in a bad temper. To drive away his unpleasant\\r\\nthoughts as he had often done before, he struck up a song at the top of\\r\\nhis voice. But as soon as he began a policeman ran up and said, with his\\r\\nfingers to the peak of his cap:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor, gentlefolk must not sing in the street! You are not a\\r\\nshoemaker!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFyodor leaned his back against a fence and fell to thinking: what could\\r\\nhe do to amuse himself?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor,” a porter shouted to him, “don’t lean against the fence,\\r\\nyou will spoil your fur coat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFyodor went into a shop and bought himself the very best concertina,\\r\\nthen went out into the street playing it. Everybody pointed at him and\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And a gentleman, too,” the cabmen jeered at him; “like some\\r\\ncobbler....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it the proper thing for gentlefolk to be disorderly in the street?”\\r\\n a policeman said to him. “You had better go into a tavern!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your honor, give us a trifle, for Christ’s sake,” the beggars wailed,\\r\\nsurrounding Fyodor on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn earlier days when he was a shoemaker the beggars took no notice of\\r\\nhim, now they wouldn’t let him pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at home his new wife, the lady, was waiting for him, dressed in a\\r\\ngreen blouse and a red skirt. He meant to be attentive to her, and had\\r\\njust lifted his arm to give her a good clout on the back, but she said\\r\\nangrily:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Peasant! Ignorant lout! You don’t know how to behave with ladies! If\\r\\nyou love me you will kiss my hand; I don’t allow you to beat me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a blasted existence!” thought Fyodor. “People do lead a life!\\r\\nYou mustn’t sing, you mustn’t play the concertina, you mustn’t have a\\r\\nlark with a lady.... Pfoo!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had no sooner sat down to tea with the lady when the evil spirit in\\r\\nthe blue spectacles appeared and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Fyodor Pantelyeitch, I have performed my part of the bargain. Now\\r\\nsign your paper and come along with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he dragged Fyodor to hell, straight to the furnace, and devils flew\\r\\nup from all directions and shouted:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fool! Blockhead! Ass!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a fearful smell of paraffin in hell, enough to suffocate one.\\r\\nAnd suddenly it all vanished. Fyodor opened his eyes and saw his table,\\r\\nthe boots, and the tin lamp. The lamp-glass was black, and from the\\r\\nfaint light on the wick came clouds of stinking smoke as from a chimney.\\r\\nNear the table stood the customer in the blue spectacles, shouting\\r\\nangrily:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fool! Blockhead! Ass! I’ll give you a lesson, you scoundrel! You took\\r\\nthe order a fortnight ago and the boots aren’t ready yet! Do you suppose\\r\\nI want to come trapesing round here half a dozen times a day for my\\r\\nboots? You wretch! you brute!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFyodor shook his head and set to work on the boots. The customer went on\\r\\nswearing and threatening him for a long time. At last when he subsided,\\r\\nFyodor asked sullenly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what is your occupation, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I make Bengal lights and fireworks. I am a pyrotechnician.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began ringing for matins. Fyodor gave the customer the boots, took\\r\\nthe money for them, and went to church.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarriages and sledges with bearskin rugs were dashing to and fro in\\r\\nthe street; merchants, ladies, officers were walking along the pavement\\r\\ntogether with the humbler folk.... But Fyodor did not envy them nor\\r\\nrepine at his lot. It seemed to him now that rich and poor were equally\\r\\nbadly off. Some were able to drive in a carriage, and others to sing\\r\\nsongs at the top of their voice and to play the concertina, but one and\\r\\nthe same thing, the same grave, was awaiting all alike, and there was\\r\\nnothing in life for which one would give the devil even a tiny scrap of\\r\\none’s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

            "Marya had long been snoring on the stove; all the paraffin in the little lamp had burnt out, but Fyodor Nilov still sat at work. He would long ago have flung aside his work and gone out into the street, but a customer from Kolokolny Lane, who had a fortnight before ordered some boots, had been in the previous day, had abused him roundly, and had ordered him to finish the boots at once before the morning service.  “It’s a convict’s life!” Fyodor grumbled as he worked. “Some people have been asleep long ago, others are enjoying themselves, while you sit here like some Cain and sew for the devil knows whom....”  To save himself from accidentally falling asleep, he kept taking a bottle from under the table and drinking out of it, and after every pull at it he twisted his head and said aloud:  “What is the reason, kindly tell me, that customers enjoy themselves while I am forced to sit and work for them? Because they have money and I am a beggar?”  He hated all his customers, especially the one who lived in Kolokolny Lane. He was a gentleman of gloomy appearance, with long hair, a yellow face, blue spectacles, and a husky voice. He had a German name which one could not pronounce. It was impossible to tell what was his calling and what he did. When, a fortnight before, Fyodor had gone to take his measure, he, the customer, was sitting on the floor pounding something in a mortar. Before Fyodor had time to say good-morning the contents of the mortar suddenly flared up and burned with a bright red flame; there was a stink of sulphur and burnt feathers, and the room was filled with a thick pink smoke, so that Fyodor sneezed five times; and as he returned home afterwards, he thought: “Anyone who feared God would not have anything to do with things like that.”  When there was nothing left in the bottle Fyodor put the boots on the table and sank into thought. He leaned his heavy head on his fist and began thinking of his poverty, of his hard life with no glimmer of light in it. Then he thought of the rich, of their big houses and their carriages, of their hundred-rouble notes.... How nice it would be if the houses of these rich men--the devil flay them!--were smashed, if their horses died, if their fur coats and sable caps got shabby! How splendid it would be if the rich, little by little, changed into beggars having nothing, and he, a poor shoemaker, were to become rich, and were to lord it over some other poor shoemaker on Christmas Eve.  Dreaming like this, Fyodor suddenly thought of his work, and opened his eyes.  “Here’s a go,” he thought, looking at the boots. “The job has been finished ever so long ago, and I go on sitting here. I must take the boots to the gentleman.”  He wrapped up the work in a red handkerchief, put on his things, and went out into the street. A fine hard snow was falling, pricking the face as though with needles. It was cold, slippery, dark, the gas-lamps burned dimly, and for some reason there was a smell of paraffin in the street, so that Fyodor coughed and cleared his throat. Rich men were driving to and fro on the road, and every rich man had a ham and a bottle of vodka in his hands. Rich young ladies peeped at Fyodor out of the carriages and sledges, put out their tongues and shouted, laughing:  “Beggar! Beggar!”  Students, officers, and merchants walked behind Fyodor, jeering at him and crying:  “Drunkard! Drunkard! Infidel cobbler! Soul of a boot-leg! Beggar!”  All this was insulting, but Fyodor held his tongue and only spat in disgust. But when Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, a master-bootmaker, met him and said: “I’ve married a rich woman and I have men working under me, while you are a beggar and have nothing to eat,” Fyodor could not refrain from running after him. He pursued him till he found himself in Kolokolny Lane. His customer lived in the fourth house from the corner on the very top floor. To reach him one had to go through a long, dark courtyard, and then to climb up a very high slippery stair-case which tottered under one’s feet. When Fyodor went in to him he was sitting on the floor pounding something in a mortar, just as he had been the fortnight before.  “Your honor, I have brought your boots,” said Fyodor sullenly.  The customer got up and began trying on the boots in silence. Desiring to help him, Fyodor went down on one knee and pulled off his old, boot, but at once jumped up and staggered towards the door in horror. The customer had not a foot, but a hoof like a horse’s.  “Aha!” thought Fyodor; “here’s a go!”  The first thing should have been to cross himself, then to leave everything and run downstairs; but he immediately reflected that he was meeting a devil for the first and probably the last time, and not to take advantage of his services would be foolish. He controlled himself and determined to try his luck. Clasping his hands behind him to avoid making the sign of the cross, he coughed respectfully and began:  “They say that there is nothing on earth more evil and impure than the devil, but I am of the opinion, your honor, that the devil is highly educated. He has--excuse my saying it--hoofs and a tail behind, but he has more brains than many a student.”  “I like you for what you say,” said the devil, flattered. “Thank you, shoemaker! What do you want?”  And without loss of time the shoemaker began complaining of his lot. He began by saying that from his childhood up he had envied the rich. He had always resented it that all people did not live alike in big houses and drive with good horses. Why, he asked, was he poor? How was he worse than Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, who had his own house, and whose wife wore a hat? He had the same sort of nose, the same hands, feet, head, and back, as the rich, and so why was he forced to work when others were enjoying themselves? Why was he married to Marya and not to a lady smelling of scent? He had often seen beautiful young ladies in the houses of rich customers, but they either took no notice of him whatever, or else sometimes laughed and whispered to each other: “What a red nose that shoemaker has!” It was true that Marya was a good, kind, hard-working woman, but she was not educated; her hand was heavy and hit hard, and if one had occasion to speak of politics or anything intellectual before her, she would put her spoke in and talk the most awful nonsense.  “What do you want, then?” his customer interrupted him.  “I beg you, your honor Satan Ivanitch, to be graciously pleased to make me a rich man.”  “Certainly. Only for that you must give me up your soul! Before the cocks crow, go and sign on this paper here that you give me up your soul.”  “Your honor,” said Fyodor politely, “when you ordered a pair of boots from me I did not ask for the money in advance. One has first to carry out the order and then ask for payment.”  “Oh, very well!” the customer assented.  A bright flame suddenly flared up in the mortar, a pink thick smoke came puffing out, and there was a smell of burnt feathers and sulphur. When the smoke had subsided, Fyodor rubbed his eyes and saw that he was no longer Fyodor, no longer a shoemaker, but quite a different man, wearing a waistcoat and a watch-chain, in a new pair of trousers, and that he was sitting in an armchair at a big table. Two foot men were handing him dishes, bowing low and saying:  “Kindly eat, your honor, and may it do you good!”  What wealth! The footmen handed him a big piece of roast mutton and a dish of cucumbers, and then brought in a frying-pan a roast goose, and a little afterwards boiled pork with horse-radish cream. And how dignified, how genteel it all was! Fyodor ate, and before each dish drank a big glass of excellent vodka, like some general or some count. After the pork he was handed some boiled grain moistened with goose fat, then an omelette with bacon fat, then fried liver, and he went on eating and was delighted. What more? They served, too, a pie with onion and steamed turnip with kvass.  “How is it the gentry don’t burst with such meals?” he thought.  In conclusion they handed him a big pot of honey. After dinner the devil appeared in blue spectacles and asked with a low bow:  “Are you satisfied with your dinner, Fyodor Pantelyeitch?”  But Fyodor could not answer one word, he was so stuffed after his dinner. The feeling of repletion was unpleasant, oppressive, and to distract his thoughts he looked at the boot on his left foot.  “For a boot like that I used not to take less than seven and a half roubles. What shoemaker made it?” he asked.  “Kuzma Lebyodkin,” answered the footman.  “Send for him, the fool!”  Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw soon made his appearance. He stopped in a respectful attitude at the door and asked:  “What are your orders, your honor?”  “Hold your tongue!” cried Fyodor, and stamped his foot. “Don’t dare to argue; remember your place as a cobbler! Blockhead! You don’t know how to make boots! I’ll beat your ugly phiz to a jelly! Why have you come?”  “For money.”  “What money? Be off! Come on Saturday! Boy, give him a cuff!”  But he at once recalled what a life the customers used to lead him, too, and he felt heavy at heart, and to distract his attention he took a fat pocketbook out of his pocket and began counting his money. There was a great deal of money, but Fyodor wanted more still. The devil in the blue spectacles brought him another notebook fatter still, but he wanted even more; and the more he counted it, the more discontented he became.  In the evening the evil one brought him a full-bosomed lady in a red dress, and said that this was his new wife. He spent the whole evening kissing her and eating gingerbreads, and at night he went to bed on a soft, downy feather-bed, turned from side to side, and could not go to sleep. He felt uncanny.  “We have a great deal of money,” he said to his wife; “we must look out or thieves will be breaking in. You had better go and look with a candle.”  He did not sleep all night, and kept getting up to see if his box was all right. In the morning he had to go to church to matins. In church the same honor is done to rich and poor alike. When Fyodor was poor he used to pray in church like this: “God, forgive me, a sinner!” He said the same thing now though he had become rich. What difference was there? And after death Fyodor rich would not be buried in gold, not in diamonds, but in the same black earth as the poorest beggar. Fyodor would burn in the same fire as cobblers. Fyodor resented all this, and, too, he felt weighed down all over by his dinner, and instead of prayer he had all sorts of thoughts in his head about his box of money, about thieves, about his bartered, ruined soul.  He came out of church in a bad temper. To drive away his unpleasant thoughts as he had often done before, he struck up a song at the top of his voice. But as soon as he began a policeman ran up and said, with his fingers to the peak of his cap:  “Your honor, gentlefolk must not sing in the street! You are not a shoemaker!”  Fyodor leaned his back against a fence and fell to thinking: what could he do to amuse himself?  “Your honor,” a porter shouted to him, “don’t lean against the fence, you will spoil your fur coat!”  Fyodor went into a shop and bought himself the very best concertina, then went out into the street playing it. Everybody pointed at him and laughed.  “And a gentleman, too,” the cabmen jeered at him; “like some cobbler....”  “Is it the proper thing for gentlefolk to be disorderly in the street?” a policeman said to him. “You had better go into a tavern!”  “Your honor, give us a trifle, for Christ’s sake,” the beggars wailed, surrounding Fyodor on all sides.  In earlier days when he was a shoemaker the beggars took no notice of him, now they wouldn’t let him pass.  And at home his new wife, the lady, was waiting for him, dressed in a green blouse and a red skirt. He meant to be attentive to her, and had just lifted his arm to give her a good clout on the back, but she said angrily:  “Peasant! Ignorant lout! You don’t know how to behave with ladies! If you love me you will kiss my hand; I don’t allow you to beat me.”  “This is a blasted existence!” thought Fyodor. “People do lead a life! You mustn’t sing, you mustn’t play the concertina, you mustn’t have a lark with a lady.... Pfoo!”  He had no sooner sat down to tea with the lady when the evil spirit in the blue spectacles appeared and said:  “Come, Fyodor Pantelyeitch, I have performed my part of the bargain. Now sign your paper and come along with me!”  And he dragged Fyodor to hell, straight to the furnace, and devils flew up from all directions and shouted:  “Fool! Blockhead! Ass!”  There was a fearful smell of paraffin in hell, enough to suffocate one. And suddenly it all vanished. Fyodor opened his eyes and saw his table, the boots, and the tin lamp. The lamp-glass was black, and from the faint light on the wick came clouds of stinking smoke as from a chimney. Near the table stood the customer in the blue spectacles, shouting angrily:  “Fool! Blockhead! Ass! I’ll give you a lesson, you scoundrel! You took the order a fortnight ago and the boots aren’t ready yet! Do you suppose I want to come trapesing round here half a dozen times a day for my boots? You wretch! you brute!”  Fyodor shook his head and set to work on the boots. The customer went on swearing and threatening him for a long time. At last when he subsided, Fyodor asked sullenly:  “And what is your occupation, sir?”  “I make Bengal lights and fireworks. I am a pyrotechnician.”  They began ringing for matins. Fyodor gave the customer the boots, took the money for them, and went to church.  Carriages and sledges with bearskin rugs were dashing to and fro in the street; merchants, ladies, officers were walking along the pavement together with the humbler folk.... But Fyodor did not envy them nor repine at his lot. It seemed to him now that rich and poor were equally badly off. Some were able to drive in a carriage, and others to sing songs at the top of their voice and to play the concertina, but one and the same thing, the same grave, was awaiting all alike, and there was nothing in life for which one would give the devil even a tiny scrap of one’s soul.\n"

            "Marya had long been snoring on the stove; all the paraffin in the little lamp had burnt out, but Fyodor Nilov still sat at work. He would long ago have flung aside his work and gone out into the street, but a customer from Kolokolny Lane, who had a fortnight before ordered some boots, had been in the previous day, had abused him roundly, and had ordered him to finish the boots at once before the morning service.  “It’s a convict’s life!” Fyodor grumbled as he worked. “Some people have been asleep long ago, others are enjoying themselves, while you sit here like some Cain and sew for the devil knows whom....”  To save himself from accidentally falling asleep, he kept taking a bottle from under the table and drinking out of it, and after every pull at it he twisted his head and said aloud:  “What is the reason, kindly tell me, that customers enjoy themselves while I am forced to sit and work for them? Because they have money and I am a beggar?”  He hated all his customers, especially the one who lived in Kolokolny Lane. He was a gentleman of gloomy appearance, with long hair, a yellow face, blue spectacles, and a husky voice. He had a German name which one could not pronounce. It was impossible to tell what was his calling and what he did. When, a fortnight before, Fyodor had gone to take his measure, he, the customer, was sitting on the floor pounding something in a mortar. Before Fyodor had time to say good-morning the contents of the mortar suddenly flared up and burned with a bright red flame; there was a stink of sulphur and burnt feathers, and the room was filled with a thick pink smoke, so that Fyodor sneezed five times; and as he returned home afterwards, he thought: “Anyone who feared God would not have anything to do with things like that.”  When there was nothing left in the bottle Fyodor put the boots on the table and sank into thought. He leaned his heavy head on his fist and began thinking of his poverty, of his hard life with no glimmer of light in it. Then he thought of the rich, of their big houses and their carriages, of their hundred-rouble notes.... How nice it would be if the houses of these rich men--the devil flay them!--were smashed, if their horses died, if their fur coats and sable caps got shabby! How splendid it would be if the rich, little by little, changed into beggars having nothing, and he, a poor shoemaker, were to become rich, and were to lord it over some other poor shoemaker on Christmas Eve.  Dreaming like this, Fyodor suddenly thought of his work, and opened his eyes.  “Here’s a go,” he thought, looking at the boots. “The job has been finished ever so long ago, and I go on sitting here. I must take the boots to the gentleman.”  He wrapped up the work in a red handkerchief, put on his things, and went out into the street. A fine hard snow was falling, pricking the face as though with needles. It was cold, slippery, dark, the gas-lamps burned dimly, and for some reason there was a smell of paraffin in the street, so that Fyodor coughed and cleared his throat. Rich men were driving to and fro on the road, and every rich man had a ham and a bottle of vodka in his hands. Rich young ladies peeped at Fyodor out of the carriages and sledges, put out their tongues and shouted, laughing:  “Beggar! Beggar!”  Students, officers, and merchants walked behind Fyodor, jeering at him and crying:  “Drunkard! Drunkard! Infidel cobbler! Soul of a boot-leg! Beggar!”  All this was insulting, but Fyodor held his tongue and only spat in disgust. But when Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, a master-bootmaker, met him and said: “I’ve married a rich woman and I have men working under me, while you are a beggar and have nothing to eat,” Fyodor could not refrain from running after him. He pursued him till he found himself in Kolokolny Lane. His customer lived in the fourth house from the corner on the very top floor. To reach him one had to go through a long, dark courtyard, and then to climb up a very high slippery stair-case which tottered under one’s feet. When Fyodor went in to him he was sitting on the floor pounding something in a mortar, just as he had been the fortnight before.  “Your honor, I have brought your boots,” said Fyodor sullenly.  The customer got up and began trying on the boots in silence. Desiring to help him, Fyodor went down on one knee and pulled off his old, boot, but at once jumped up and staggered towards the door in horror. The customer had not a foot, but a hoof like a horse’s.  “Aha!” thought Fyodor; “here’s a go!”  The first thing should have been to cross himself, then to leave everything and run downstairs; but he immediately reflected that he was meeting a devil for the first and probably the last time, and not to take advantage of his services would be foolish. He controlled himself and determined to try his luck. Clasping his hands behind him to avoid making the sign of the cross, he coughed respectfully and began:  “They say that there is nothing on earth more evil and impure than the devil, but I am of the opinion, your honor, that the devil is highly educated. He has--excuse my saying it--hoofs and a tail behind, but he has more brains than many a student.”  “I like you for what you say,” said the devil, flattered. “Thank you, shoemaker! What do you want?”  And without loss of time the shoemaker began complaining of his lot. He began by saying that from his childhood up he had envied the rich. He had always resented it that all people did not live alike in big houses and drive with good horses. Why, he asked, was he poor? How was he worse than Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, who had his own house, and whose wife wore a hat? He had the same sort of nose, the same hands, feet, head, and back, as the rich, and so why was he forced to work when others were enjoying themselves? Why was he married to Marya and not to a lady smelling of scent? He had often seen beautiful young ladies in the houses of rich customers, but they either took no notice of him whatever, or else sometimes laughed and whispered to each other: “What a red nose that shoemaker has!” It was true that Marya was a good, kind, hard-working woman, but she was not educated; her hand was heavy and hit hard, and if one had occasion to speak of politics or anything intellectual before her, she would put her spoke in and talk the most awful nonsense.  “What do you want, then?” his customer interrupted him.  “I beg you, your honor Satan Ivanitch, to be graciously pleased to make me a rich man.”  “Certainly. Only for that you must give me up your soul! Before the cocks crow, go and sign on this paper here that you give me up your soul.”  “Your honor,” said Fyodor politely, “when you ordered a pair of boots from me I did not ask for the money in advance. One has first to carry out the order and then ask for payment.”  “Oh, very well!” the customer assented.  A bright flame suddenly flared up in the mortar, a pink thick smoke came puffing out, and there was a smell of burnt feathers and sulphur. When the smoke had subsided, Fyodor rubbed his eyes and saw that he was no longer Fyodor, no longer a shoemaker, but quite a different man, wearing a waistcoat and a watch-chain, in a new pair of trousers, and that he was sitting in an armchair at a big table. Two foot men were handing him dishes, bowing low and saying:  “Kindly eat, your honor, and may it do you good!”  What wealth! The footmen handed him a big piece of roast mutton and a dish of cucumbers, and then brought in a frying-pan a roast goose, and a little afterwards boiled pork with horse-radish cream. And how dignified, how genteel it all was! Fyodor ate, and before each dish drank a big glass of excellent vodka, like some general or some count. After the pork he was handed some boiled grain moistened with goose fat, then an omelette with bacon fat, then fried liver, and he went on eating and was delighted. What more? They served, too, a pie with onion and steamed turnip with kvass.  “How is it the gentry don’t burst with such meals?” he thought.  In conclusion they handed him a big pot of honey. After dinner the devil appeared in blue spectacles and asked with a low bow:  “Are you satisfied with your dinner, Fyodor Pantelyeitch?”  But Fyodor could not answer one word, he was so stuffed after his dinner. The feeling of repletion was unpleasant, oppressive, and to distract his thoughts he looked at the boot on his left foot.  “For a boot like that I used not to take less than seven and a half roubles. What shoemaker made it?” he asked.  “Kuzma Lebyodkin,” answered the footman.  “Send for him, the fool!”  Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw soon made his appearance. He stopped in a respectful attitude at the door and asked:  “What are your orders, your honor?”  “Hold your tongue!” cried Fyodor, and stamped his foot. “Don’t dare to argue; remember your place as a cobbler!
